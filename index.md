## Preamble: The Bundle as the True Architecture

This project is an audit. It maps the hidden geometry of modern science.

The premise of `jetbundle` is that mathematics, physics, computer science, and finance are not independent disciplines. They are components of a single, unified structure—a **fiber bundle**—whose geometry is dictated by patronage.

In this model:

1. **The Base Space** is "pure" academia: the university curriculum, the syllabus, the textbook, the journal paper. It is the world of abstract, "unmotivated" definitions—the "ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics" that Vladimir Arnold identified.

2. **The Fiber** is the world of classified, high-stakes, material applications. It is the *actual problem* a given abstraction was funded to solve. At the point on the Base Space labeled "Complex Analysis," the attached Fiber contains the classified blueprints for a *Nautilus* submarine hull, designed to minimize hydrodynamic noise.

3. **The Connection** is the flow of funding. This connection—the grants from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), DARPA, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)—defines the "curvature" of the entire system. It dictates how and why the "pure" research of the Base Space is forced to bend to serve the applied needs of the Fiber.

This site is the open-source audit of that structure. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline.

## Part I: The Base Space (The Cartography)

The most effective map of the Base Space remains Vladimir Arnold's 1995 tripartition. It is not a philosophy, but a verifiable econometric model of 20th-century R&D.

- **Cryptography (The "Enigma"):** Funded by intelligence agencies ("CIA, KGB and the like"), this pillar generated the demand for number theory, algebraic geometry over finite fields, and algebra.

- **Hydrodynamics (The "Submarine"):** Supported by "manufacturers of atomic submarines," this pillar procreated complex analysis, partial differential equations, and scientific computing.

- **Celestial Mechanics (The "Missile"):** Financed by "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA," this pillar was the origin of dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, and variational calculus.

The "pure," axiomatic formalism of collectives like Nicolas Bourbaki (est. 1934) was the crucial "laundering" mechanism. It provided the intellectual camouflage necessary to resolve the central contradiction of the post-WWII era: how to accept secret military funding while maintaining a public identity of "pure," apolitical inquiry. Abstraction became the mechanism of redaction.

This was not a secret. DARPA's 2007 "Mathematical Challenges" BAA explicitly solicited foundational "lemmas" as deliverables, such as "Settle the Hodge Conjecture" (Challenge 21) and "replace linear algebra by algebraic geometry" (Challenge 8).

## Part II: The Fibers (The Applied Stacks)

The "Base Space" of mathematics maps directly onto the applied "Fibers" of technology. The CS and QF curricula are not new subjects; they are bundles of these mathematical tools, optimized for a specific set of problems.

### Fiber 1: The C3I & Surveillance Stack (AI, OS, Crypto, Graphs)

This stack comprises the technologies of **Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**.

- **Operating Systems:** The modern OS is a direct descendant of the 1960s military requirement for a "Survivable SAC command net". J.C.R. Licklider, as director of DARPA's IPTO, executed this mandate by funding MIT's **Project MAC**—the project that built **Multics**, the ancestor of all modern OS. This 60-year institutional lineage is unbroken: the "Modern Patron" is the same DoD, which now leases this "computer utility" from Microsoft, whose **Azure Kubernetes Service** is formally authorized for **DoD Impact Level 5 (IL5)** workloads.

- **Artificial Intelligence:** The 1980s neural net revival was funded by ONR and DARPA. The "Killer App" was **ALVINN** (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network), a 3-layer backpropagation network built to drive an autonomous HUMVEE. The "Modern Patrons," **Palantir** and **Anduril**, are operationalizing this 1980s R&D for AI-driven drone swarms and targeting systems.

- **Graph Theory:** This is the "skeleton key" Fiber for C3I. Its origin is Pál Turán's 1941 "brick factory problem," conceived in a forced-labor camp. The math (extremal graph theory) was operationalized by the NSA in its **SKYNET** program, which uses graph centrality algorithms on metadata to find "cliques" of "suspect activity" for drone targeting. This *exact* social network analysis is the core product of **Palantir Gotham**, sold to clients like ICE and the NYPD.

### Fiber 2: The Ballistics & Hydrodynamics Stack

- **Complex Analysis:** Funded by ONR for conformal mapping of *Nautilus* submarine hulls to minimize hydrodynamic noise vortices.

- **Partial Differential Equations:** Funded for H-bomb shock-wave calculations and hypersonic vehicle design.

- **Scientific Computing:** Funded for Los Alamos implosion simulations and modern stockpile stewardship.

### Fiber 3: The Military-Financial Stack (Quantitative Finance)

The "Great Handover" occurred when Wall Street outbid the Pentagon. Quantitative finance did not invent new mathematics; it "re-skinned" the DoD's toolkit for a new problem set: the market.

- **Missile Guidance → Time-Series Analysis:** The **Kalman Filter** was funded by the AFOSR in 1954 and was the "essential" GNC tool for the Apollo program's mid-course corrections and the Minuteman-III ICBM. This is the *exact* math taught in `AMS 578: Regression Theory` and is now the quintessential tool for filtering a "true" asset signal from "noisy" market data.

- **Ballistics → Derivatives Pricing:** **Pontryagin's Maximum Principle** (1956) was funded by AFOSR to solve the "optimal Titan-II ascent trajectory"—a problem in solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is the *exact* math taught in `AMS 527: Numerical Analysis`, now "re-skinned" to solve the Black-Scholes **PDE** for option pricing.

- **Naval Warfare → High-Frequency Trading (HFT):** HFT firms like Jane Street and Citadel compete in "latency arbitrage"—a "race on speed". The math they use is from `AMS 523: Mathematics of High Frequency Finance`—the "Fourier transforms" and "conformal mapping" originally funded by ONR for **radar signal processing** and **Nautilus hull hydrodynamics**. The HFT firms *physically build a graph* of "terrestrial microwave networks" to find the "shortest-path (geodesic)", running the *same* signal-processing algorithms to win a microsecond race.

## Part III: The Connection (The Dynamics of the Stack)

The "Connection" (funding) is not static; it is a dynamic force that pulls ideas across the Base Space and through time.

- **The "Migratory App":** A "killer app" migrates across academic disciplines, pulled by patronage. The **Kalman Filter** is the archetype.
  1. **Probability (ONR):** Funded as a *probabilistic* tool for SONAR contact tracking.
  2. **Dynamical Systems (NASA):** Adopted as a *navigational* tool for Apollo.
  3. **Linear Algebra (ARO):** Funded as a *computational* tool for the Minuteman-III.

- **The "18-Year Lag":** This is the "declassification by syllabus."
  1. **The "Memo" (c. 1978):** Leslie Lamport's **Byzantine Generals Problem** is created as an explicit parable for a DARPA C3 (Command, Control, Communications) requirement: a survivable nuclear command network.
  2. **The "Lemma" (c. 1999):** Lamport wins the Turing Award, cementing the problem as a "pure," abstract concept in distributed systems.
  3. **The "Syllabus" (c. 2017):** The problem appears in the MIT 6.033 syllabus, its nuclear-war origins fully redacted.

## Part IV: The `jetbundle` Project

This project is the open-source initiative to map this bundle. The `jetbundle.github.io` site serves as the primer, the audit trail, and the central hub.

- **The Archive** contains the declassified memos, booklists, and primary sources.
- **The Audits** apply this forensic methodology to new fields.
- **The Simulations** provide open-source code to explore the "lemmas" (Kalman filters, Turán graphs, Byzantine consensus).

The goal is to remove the redactions. The audit trail is the curriculum.
