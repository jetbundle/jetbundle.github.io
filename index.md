# JetBundle

**Mapping the hidden geometry of modern science.**

## Preamble: The Bundle as the True Architecture

This project is an audit. It maps the hidden geometry of modern science.

The premise of `jetbundle` is that mathematics, physics, computer science, and finance are not independent disciplines. They are components of a single, unified structure—a **fiber bundle**—whose geometry is dictated by patronage.

In this model:

1. **The Base Space** is "pure" academia: the university curriculum, the syllabus, the textbook, the journal paper. It is the world of abstract, "unmotivated" definitions—the "ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics" that Vladimir Arnold identified.

2. **The Fiber** is the world of classified, high-stakes, material applications. It is the *actual problem* a given abstraction was funded to solve. At the point on the Base Space labeled "Complex Analysis," the attached Fiber contains the classified blueprints for a *Nautilus* submarine hull. At "Graph Theory," the Fiber contains the NSA's SKYNET drone-targeting algorithm.

3. **The Connection** is the flow of funding. This connection—the grants from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), DARPA, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)—defines the "curvature" of the entire system. It dictates how and why the "pure" research of the Base Space is forced to bend to serve the applied needs of the Fiber.

This site is the open-source audit of that structure. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline.

## The Three Foundations

Mastery of **Physics, Finance, and Computation** are the fundamentals for becoming a 21st-century scientist and engineer in a world transformed by artificial intelligence. These three disciplines form the core of human value: eudaimonia through free thinking, free building, and engineering excellence.

### [Computation Stack →](/computation_stack/01_intro/)

**Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**

- Operating Systems: From Project MAC to Azure IL5
- Artificial Intelligence: From ALVINN to Palantir
- Graph Theory: From Turán to SKYNET to Palantir Gotham

### [Physics Stack →](/physics_stack/01_intro/)

**Naval Warfare & Missile Guidance**

- Complex Analysis: From *Nautilus* hulls to aircraft wings
- PDEs: From H-bomb shock-waves to hypersonic vehicles
- Scientific Computing: From Los Alamos to stockpile simulations

### [Finance Stack →](/finance_stack/01_intro/)

**The Great Handover: Wall Street Outbids the Pentagon**

- Kalman Filter: From missile guidance to time-series analysis
- Pontryagin's Principle: From ballistic trajectories to options pricing
- High-Frequency Trading: From radar signal processing to microwave networks

## The Base Space (The Cartography)

[The Master Cartography →](/cartography/)

The mathematical foundations mapped to their material origins.

## The Connection (The Archive)

[The Archive →](/archive/)

Declassified memos, booklists, and primary sources tracing the funding pipeline.

## Part I: The Base Space (The Cartography)

The most effective map of the Base Space remains Vladimir Arnold's 1995 tripartition. It is not a philosophy, but a verifiable econometric model of 20th-century R&D.

- **Cryptography (The "Enigma"):** Funded by intelligence agencies ("CIA, KGB and the like"), this pillar generated the demand for number theory, algebraic geometry over finite fields, and algebra.

- **Hydrodynamics (The "Submarine"):** Supported by "manufacturers of atomic submarines," this pillar procreated complex analysis, partial differential equations, and scientific computing.

- **Celestial Mechanics (The "Missile"):** Financed by "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA," this pillar was the origin of dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, and variational calculus.

The "pure," axiomatic formalism of collectives like Nicolas Bourbaki (est. 1934) was the crucial "laundering" mechanism. It provided the intellectual camouflage necessary to resolve the central contradiction of the post-WWII era: how to accept secret military funding while maintaining a public identity of "pure," apolitical inquiry. Abstraction became the mechanism of redaction.

## Part II: The Connection (The Dynamics of the Stack)

The "Connection" (funding) is not static; it is a dynamic force that pulls ideas across the Base Space and through time.

### The "Migratory App"

A "killer app" migrates across academic disciplines, pulled by patronage. The **Kalman Filter** is the archetype.

1. **Probability (ONR):** Funded as a *probabilistic* tool for SONAR contact tracking.
2. **Dynamical Systems (NASA):** Adopted as a *navigational* tool for Apollo.
3. **Linear Algebra (ARO):** Funded as a *computational* tool for the Minuteman-III.

### The "18-Year Lag"

This is the "declassification by syllabus."

1. **The "Memo" (c. 1978):** Leslie Lamport's **Byzantine Generals Problem** is created as an explicit parable for a DARPA C3 (Command, Control, Communications) requirement: a survivable nuclear command network.

2. **The "Lemma" (c. 1999):** Lamport wins the Turing Award, cementing the problem as a "pure," abstract concept in distributed systems.

3. **The "Syllabus" (c. 2017):** The problem appears in the MIT 6.033 syllabus, its nuclear-war origins fully redacted.

## Part III: The `jetbundle` Project

This project is the open-source initiative to map this bundle. The `jetbundle.github.io` site serves as the primer, the audit trail, and the central hub.

- **The Archive** contains the declassified memos, booklists, and primary sources.
- **The Audits** apply this forensic methodology to new fields.
- **The Simulations** provide open-source code to explore the "lemmas" (Kalman filters, Turán graphs, Byzantine consensus).

The goal is to remove the redactions. The audit trail is the curriculum.
