# AI Audit: From ALVINN to Palantir

## The 1980s Neural Net Revival

The 1980s neural network revival was funded by ONR and DARPA. This was not "pure" research; it was driven by a specific military requirement: autonomous vehicle navigation.

## The Killer App: ALVINN

**ALVINN** (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) was a 3-layer backpropagation network built to drive an autonomous HUMVEE.

### Technical Details

- **Architecture**: 3-layer neural network
- **Training**: Backpropagation algorithm
- **Input**: Camera images (30x32 pixels)
- **Output**: Steering angle
- **Funding**: ONR and DARPA
- **Application**: Autonomous military vehicle navigation

### The Significance

ALVINN demonstrated that neural networks could solve real-world control problems. This 1980s R&D became the foundation for:

- Modern autonomous vehicles
- Drone navigation systems
- Robotic control systems
- Computer vision applications

## Modern Patrons

**Palantir** and **Anduril** are operationalizing this 1980s R&D for:

- **AI-driven drone swarms**: Autonomous coordination and targeting
- **Targeting systems**: Computer vision for identification and tracking
- **Surveillance systems**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection

## The Connection

The same mathematical techniques (backpropagation, neural networks) funded by ONR and DARPA in the 1980s are now the core technology of modern AI systems used by defense contractors and intelligence agencies.

## Key Documents

- **ALVINN Research Papers** - Original neural network research
- **DARPA Autonomous Vehicle Programs** - Military funding records
- **Palantir Technical Publications** - Modern applications
