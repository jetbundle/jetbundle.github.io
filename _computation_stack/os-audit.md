# Operating Systems Audit: From Project MAC to Azure IL5

## The Military Requirement

The modern operating system is a direct descendant of the 1960s military requirement for a "Survivable SAC command net"—a distributed computing system that could survive a nuclear first strike and maintain command and control of Strategic Air Command bombers.

## The First Cheque: DARPA IPTO

J.C.R. Licklider, as director of DARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), executed this mandate by funding MIT's **Project MAC** (Mathematics and Computation, later "Multiple Access Computer").

### Project MAC (1963-1970)

- **Funding**: DARPA IPTO
- **Objective**: Build a time-sharing, multi-user computing system
- **Deliverable**: Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)
- **Architecture**: Ring-based security, hierarchical file system, dynamic linking

### The Multics Lineage

**Multics (1969)** → **UNIX (1971)** → **POSIX (1988)** → **Linux (1991)** → **Cloud OS (2000s)**

## The 60-Year Institutional Lineage

The "Modern Patron" is the same DoD that funded Project MAC. The institutional continuity is unbroken:

1. **1960s**: DoD funds Project MAC via DARPA
2. **1970s**: DoD adopts UNIX for military computing
3. **1980s**: DoD mandates POSIX compliance
4. **1990s**: DoD uses Linux for classified systems
5. **2000s**: DoD migrates to cloud computing
6. **2010s**: Microsoft Azure authorized for **DoD Impact Level 5 (IL5)** workloads

## The Connection

Microsoft's **Azure Kubernetes Service** is formally authorized for **DoD Impact Level 5 (IL5)** workloads—the same "computer utility" concept that DARPA funded in 1963, now leased back to the DoD.

## Key Documents

- **"Intergalactic Computer Network" Memo** (April 23, 1963) - J.C.R. Licklider's vision
- **Project MAC Documentation** - MIT's time-sharing research
- **DoD Cloud Computing Strategy** - Modern authorization documents
