# The Computation Stack

This stack comprises the technologies of **Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**—the computational foundations of modern systems.

## Overview

The Computation Stack traces the lineage from military command and control requirements to modern surveillance and artificial intelligence systems. The foundational mathematics (graph theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry) was funded to solve specific intelligence and command problems, then "laundered" through academic abstraction into "pure" computer science.

## Core Components

### Operating Systems

The modern OS is a direct descendant of the 1960s military requirement for a "Survivable SAC command net". J.C.R. Licklider, as director of DARPA's IPTO, executed this mandate by funding MIT's **Project MAC**—the project that built **Multics**, the ancestor of all modern OS.

**The Lineage**:
- **1960s**: DARPA IPTO funds Project MAC (MIT)
- **1969**: Multics operational
- **1970s**: UNIX derived from Multics
- **1980s**: POSIX standards
- **2000s**: Linux, macOS, Windows all trace to this lineage
- **2020s**: Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service authorized for **DoD Impact Level 5 (IL5)** workloads

**The Connection**: The same DoD that funded Project MAC now leases the "computer utility" from Microsoft.

### Artificial Intelligence

The 1980s neural net revival was funded by ONR and DARPA. The "Killer App" was **ALVINN** (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network), a 3-layer backpropagation network built to drive an autonomous HUMVEE.

**Modern Patrons**: **Palantir** and **Anduril** are operationalizing this 1980s R&D for AI-driven drone swarms and targeting systems.

### Graph Theory

This is the "skeleton key" Fiber for Computation. Its origin is Pál Turán's 1941 "brick factory problem," conceived in a forced-labor camp. The math (extremal graph theory) was operationalized by the NSA in its **SKYNET** program, which uses graph centrality algorithms on metadata to find "cliques" of "suspect activity" for drone targeting.

**Modern Application**: This *exact* social network analysis is the core product of **Palantir Gotham**, sold to clients like ICE and the NYPD.
