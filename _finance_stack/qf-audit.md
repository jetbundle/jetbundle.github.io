# Quantitative Finance Audit: From Missile Guidance to Options Pricing

## The Great Handover

The "Great Handover" occurred when Wall Street outbid the Pentagon for mathematical talent and techniques. Quantitative finance did not invent new mathematics; it "re-skinned" the DoD's toolkit for a new problem set: the market.

## The Kalman Filter Migration

### Phase 1: Military Applications (1950s-1960s)

- **1954**: AFOSR funds Rudolf Kalman's research
- **1960s**: Apollo program adopts Kalman filter for mid-course corrections
- **1960s**: Minuteman-III ICBM uses Kalman filter for guidance

### Phase 2: Academic Adoption (1970s-1980s)

- **1970s**: Kalman filter becomes standard tool in control theory
- **1980s**: Applied to financial time-series analysis
- **1990s**: Core technology for algorithmic trading

### Phase 3: Financial Applications (2000s-2020s)

- **2000s**: Quantitative finance curriculum includes Kalman filtering
- **2010s**: High-frequency trading firms use Kalman filters for signal processing
- **2020s**: Standard tool in risk management and portfolio optimization

## The Pontryagin Principle Migration

### Phase 1: Missile Trajectories (1950s-1960s)

- **1956**: Pontryagin's Maximum Principle published
- **1960s**: Applied to optimal Titan-II ascent trajectories
- **1960s**: AFOSR funds optimal control theory research

### Phase 2: Options Pricing (1970s-1980s)

- **1973**: Black-Scholes equation published (stochastic PDEs)
- **1980s**: Options pricing becomes standard financial tool
- **1990s**: Risk-neutral valuation framework established

### Phase 3: Modern Quantitative Finance (2000s-2020s)

- **2000s**: Quantitative finance curriculum includes optimal control
- **2010s**: Applied to exotic derivatives and structured products
- **2020s**: Core technology for algorithmic trading strategies

## The Curriculum Connection

The Stony Brook Quantitative Finance curriculum is a perfect audit trail of this translation:

- **AMS 578: Regression Theory** - Kalman filtering for time-series analysis
- **AMS 527: Numerical Analysis** - Solving Black-Scholes PDEs
- **AMS 523: Mathematics of High Frequency Finance** - Signal processing for HFT

## Key Documents

- **AFOSR Research Grants** - Original Kalman filter funding
- **Apollo Guidance Documentation** - Military applications
- **Black-Scholes Papers** - Financial applications
- **Quantitative Finance Curriculum** - Academic adoption
