# High-Frequency Trading Audit: From Radar to Microwave Networks

## The Problem: Latency Arbitrage

HFT firms like Jane Street and Citadel compete in "latency arbitrage"—a "race on speed". The goal is to execute trades faster than competitors, winning microsecond advantages.

## The Mathematical Foundation

The math used in HFT is from `AMS 523: Mathematics of High Frequency Finance`:

- **Fourier transforms**: Signal processing for market data
- **Conformal mapping**: Optimal path calculations
- **Graph theory**: Network routing and shortest paths

## The Military Origin

### Radar Signal Processing (1940s-1950s)

- **ONR Funding**: Radar signal processing research
- **Application**: Detecting and tracking targets
- **Technology**: Fourier transforms, signal filtering
- **Migration**: Applied to financial market data

### Submarine Acoustics (1950s-1960s)

- **ONR Funding**: Conformal mapping for hull design
- **Application**: Minimizing acoustic signature
- **Technology**: Complex analysis, conformal mapping
- **Migration**: Applied to optimal trading path calculations

## The Physical Infrastructure

HFT firms *physically build* terrestrial microwave networks to find the "shortest-path (geodesic)" between exchanges:

### Microwave Networks

- **Technology**: Terrestrial microwave communication
- **Application**: Low-latency data transmission
- **Routing**: Graph-based shortest path algorithms
- **Firms**: Jane Street, Citadel, Two Sigma, etc.

### The Race

- **Objective**: Minimize latency between exchanges
- **Method**: Physical microwave networks
- **Algorithm**: Same graph theory as SKYNET (see C3I Stack)
- **Application**: Microsecond trading advantages

## The Connection

The same mathematical techniques (Fourier transforms, conformal mapping, graph theory) originally funded by ONR for radar and submarine applications are now used by HFT firms to build physical communication networks for financial trading.

## Key Documents

- **ONR Radar Research** - Original signal processing funding
- **HFT Firm Technical Publications** - Modern applications
- **Microwave Network Documentation** - Physical infrastructure
