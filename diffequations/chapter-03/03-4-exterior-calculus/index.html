<blockquote>
<p>Differential forms are the natural language of integration on manifolds, unifying vector calculus into a coordinate-free framework that reveals the topological structure of PDEs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Section 3.1 introduced manifolds and covariant derivatives, but classical vector calculus still relied on the Euclidean structure of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. To formulate PDEs intrinsically we need a calculus that performs integration and differentiation without coordinates. <strong>Exterior Calculus</strong> provides precisely this machinery: differential forms are the natural objects of integration, the <strong>exterior derivative</strong> $d$ unifies gradient, curl, and divergence, and the <strong>Hodge star</strong> reintroduces the metric to build the Laplace–Beltrami operator. The resulting <strong>Hodge decomposition</strong> generalizes the Helmholtz decomposition of fluid mechanics to arbitrary geometries, giving solvability criteria for elliptic PDEs. References include Lee (2012), Spivak (1979), Nakahara (2003), and Frankel (2011).</p>
<h2>Differential Forms and the Wedge Product</h2>
<p>A $k$-form is a smooth section of the bundle $\Lambda^{k} T^{*}M$. At each point $p$, a $k$-form $\omega_{p}$ is an alternating $k$-linear map $T_{p}M^{\times k}\to \mathbb{R}$. Locally we write</p>
$$
\omega = \sum_{I} f_{I}(x)\, dx^{i_{1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{k}},
$$

<p>where $I=(i_{1}<\cdots<i_{k})$ is a multi-index. The <strong>wedge product</strong> equips forms with a graded-commutative algebra:</p>
$$
\alpha \wedge \beta = (-1)^{kl}\, \beta \wedge \alpha, \qquad \alpha\in \Omega^{k}, \beta\in \Omega^{\ell}.
$$

<p>Given a smooth map $\phi:M\to N$, the <strong>pullback</strong> $\phi^{*}:\Omega^{k}(N)\to \Omega^{k}(M)$ satisfies $\phi^{*}(\alpha\wedge\beta)=\phi^{*}\alpha\wedge\phi^{*}\beta$ and allows change of variables in integrals.</p>
<p><strong>Wedge Products and Pullbacks on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$</strong></p>
<p>Let $\alpha = x \, dy$ and $\beta = y \, dx + (x^{2}+y^{2}) dy$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Compute $\alpha\wedge\beta$ and the pullback under $\phi(u,v)=(u^{2}-v^{2},2uv)$.</p>
<p>Expanding the wedge product:</p>
$$
\alpha\wedge\beta = x \, dy \wedge (y \, dx + (x^{2}+y^{2})dy) = -xy \, dx \wedge dy.
$$

<p>For the pullback, we compute $\phi^{*}\alpha = (u^{2}-v^{2}) d(2uv) = 2v(u^{2}-v^{2}) du + 2u(u^{2}-v^{2}) dv$, and similarly for $\phi^{*}\beta$. Direct computation shows $\phi^{*}(\alpha\wedge\beta)=\phi^{*}\alpha\wedge\phi^{*}\beta$, illustrating the functoriality of the pullback operation.</p>
<p>The wedge product encodes the orientation of integration: $dx \wedge dy = -dy \wedge dx$ reflects the fact that reversing the order of integration changes the sign. The pullback allows us to change variables in integrals naturally, without explicit Jacobian determinants.</p>
<h2>Exterior Derivative and De Rham Cohomology</h2>
<p>The <strong>exterior derivative</strong> $d: \Omega^{k}(M)\to \Omega^{k+1}(M)$ is defined locally by</p>
$$
 d\left( \sum_{I} f_{I} dx^{I} \right) = \sum_{I,j} \partial_{x^{j}} f_{I}\, dx^{j} \wedge dx^{I},
$$

<p>and is characterized by linearity, the graded Leibniz rule, and $d^{2}=0$. Forms with $d\omega=0$ are <strong>closed</strong>; those with $\omega=d\eta$ are <strong>exact</strong>. Because $d^{2}=0$, every exact form is closed and the quotient $H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)=\ker d / \operatorname{im} d$ measures the topological obstruction to solving $d\eta=\omega$. The generalized <strong>Stokes theorem</strong> states</p>
$$
\int_{M} d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega,
$$

<p>unifying the classical integral theorems.</p>
<p><strong>Exterior Derivative Recovers Curl and Divergence</strong></p>
<p>Show that $d$ reproduces the classical operators on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.</p>
<p>For a function $f$, $df = \nabla f^{\flat}$ gives the gradient. For a 1-form $\alpha = V^{i} dx^{i}$,</p>
$$
d\alpha = (\partial_{2}V^{3}-\partial_{3}V^{2}) dy\wedge dz + (\partial_{3}V^{1}-\partial_{1}V^{3}) dz\wedge dx + (\partial_{1}V^{2}-\partial_{2}V^{1}) dx\wedge dy,
$$

<p>the coefficients of which are the components of $\nabla \times V$. For a 2-form $\beta = P dy\wedge dz + Q dz\wedge dx + R dx\wedge dy$, $d\beta = (\partial_{x}P+\partial_{y}Q+\partial_{z}R) dx\wedge dy\wedge dz$, which is the divergence of the vector field $(P,Q,R)$.</p>
<p>The exterior derivative unifies gradient, curl, and divergence into a single operator that makes sense on any manifold. The property $d^{2}=0$ encodes the classical identities $\nabla \times \nabla f = 0$ and $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times V) = 0$ in a coordinate-free way.</p>
<p><strong>Maxwell's Equations via Differential Forms</strong></p>
<p>Express the vacuum Maxwell equations on Minkowski space using the electromagnetic 2-form $F$.</p>
<p>Setting</p>
$$
F = E_{i} \, dx^{0} \wedge dx^{i} + \tfrac{1}{2} \epsilon_{ijk} B^{k} \, dx^{i} \wedge dx^{j},
$$

<p>the equations $dF=0$ encode $\nabla\cdot B=0$ and $\partial_{t}B+\nabla\times E=0$, while $\delta F=0$ (with respect to the Minkowski metric) yields $\nabla\cdot E=0$ and $\nabla\times B - \partial_{t}E=0$. Thus the four Maxwell equations collapse into $dF=0$, $\delta F=0$.</p>
<p>This elegant formulation reveals the geometric structure of electromagnetism: the field $F$ is a 2-form, and Maxwell's equations are simply the conditions that $F$ is closed and co-closed. This coordinate-free description is essential for generalizing electromagnetism to curved spacetimes in general relativity.</p>
<p><strong>de Rham Cohomology of the Torus</strong></p>
<p>Compute $H^{1}(T^{3})$ using explicit closed forms.</p>
<p>On $T^{3}=S^{1}_{\theta_{1}}\times S^{1}_{\theta_{2}}\times S^{1}_{\theta_{3}}$, the 1-forms $d\theta_{i}$ are closed. If $d\theta_{1}=d f$, periodicity forces $f$ to be globally defined with derivative 1 along $\theta_{1}$—impossible—so $d\theta_{i}$ are non-exact. Therefore $H^{1}(T^{3})\cong \mathbb{R}^{3}$ with basis $[d\theta_{1}], [d\theta_{2}], [d\theta_{3}]$.</p>
<p>De Rham cohomology measures the failure of the Poincaré lemma: on a contractible space, every closed form is exact, but on spaces with holes, there exist closed forms that are not exact. These non-exact closed forms represent topological obstructions to solving $d\eta = \omega$.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Flow on the Torus</strong></p>
<p>Analyze the 1-form $\alpha = -\sin(2\pi x) dy + \cos(2\pi y) dx$ on $T^{2}$.</p>
<p>Computing $d\alpha = 0$, so $\alpha$ is closed. Integrating $\alpha$ along the fundamental cycles shows nonzero circulation, hence $\alpha$ is not exact and represents a nontrivial cohomology class. Physically, this is an incompressible flow with topological circulation.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that cohomology classes have physical meaning: they represent conserved quantities (like circulation) that are topological rather than geometric. The Hodge decomposition will separate these topological contributions from the geometric ones.</p>
<h2>Hodge Star and Codifferential</h2>
<p>A Riemannian metric $g$ induces an inner product on forms via the <strong>Hodge star</strong> $*: \Omega^{k}(M)\to \Omega^{n-k}(M)$ defined through</p>
$$
\alpha \wedge *\beta = \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle_{g}\, \operatorname{vol}_{g}.
$$

<p>With this inner product we define the global $L^{2}$ pairing $(\alpha,\beta)=\int_{M} \alpha\wedge *\beta$ and the <strong>codifferential</strong> $\delta = (-1)^{nk+n+1} * d *$, the formal adjoint of $d$. The operator $\delta$ generalizes divergence, lowering degree by one.</p>
<p><strong>Hodge Star on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</strong></p>
<p>Compute $*\alpha$ for the standard basis.</p>
<p>With $\operatorname{vol}=dx\wedge dy\wedge dz$, we have $*dx = dy\wedge dz$, $*dy = dz\wedge dx$, $*dz = dx\wedge dy$, and $*(dx\wedge dy) = dz$. These relations verify $\alpha\wedge *\beta = \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle \, \operatorname{vol}$.</p>
<p>The Hodge star provides the metric structure needed to define inner products and adjoints. It converts $k$-forms to $(n-k)$-forms, reflecting the duality between forms of complementary degrees.</p>
<h2>Laplace–Beltrami Operator and Hodge Decomposition</h2>
<p>Combining $d$ and $\delta$ yields the <strong>Hodge Laplacian</strong></p>
$$
\Delta = d\,\delta + \delta\, d : \Omega^{k}(M) \to \Omega^{k}(M).
$$

<p>On functions $f$, $\Delta f = \delta df$ corresponds to the negative divergence of the gradient. A form is <strong>harmonic</strong> if $\Delta \omega=0$; on compact manifolds this is equivalent to $d\omega=0$ and $\delta\omega=0$. The <strong>Hodge Decomposition Theorem</strong> states that for compact $M$,</p>
$$
\Omega^{k}(M) = \mathcal{H}^{k} \oplus d\Omega^{k-1}(M) \oplus \delta\Omega^{k+1}(M),
$$

<p>where $\mathcal{H}^{k}$ is the finite-dimensional space of harmonic $k$-forms, canonically isomorphic to $H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)$. Consequently $\Delta \eta = \omega$ is solvable iff $\omega$ is orthogonal to $\mathcal{H}^{k}$, generalizing the Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields into gradient, curl, and harmonic components.</p>
<p><strong>Hodge Decomposition on $T^{2}$</strong></p>
<p>Decompose $\omega = (\sin 2\pi x + \cos 2\pi y) dx + (\cos 2\pi x - \sin 2\pi y) dy$.</p>
<p>On $T^{2}$, harmonic 1-forms are constant multiples of $dx$ and $dy$. Because $\omega$ has zero average, its harmonic part vanishes. Solving $d\alpha = d\omega$ determines the exact part; computing $\delta\beta = \delta\omega$ yields the co-exact part. Thus $\omega = d\alpha + \delta\beta$ is purely analytic, illustrating the Hodge decomposition algorithmically.</p>
<p>The Hodge decomposition separates forms into three orthogonal components: harmonic (topological), exact (geometric), and co-exact (also geometric). This decomposition is fundamental for solving elliptic PDEs: the harmonic part represents the kernel of the Laplacian, while the exact and co-exact parts can be computed by solving Poisson equations.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace–Beltrami on $S^{2}$</strong></p>
<p>Determine the harmonic 0-forms on the sphere.</p>
<p>On $S^{2}$ with Laplacian $\Delta f = \delta df$, separation of variables gives eigenfunctions $Y_{\ell}^{m}$ with eigenvalues $\ell(\ell+1)$. Only $\ell=0$ (constant functions) satisfy $\Delta f=0$, in agreement with the fact that $H^{0}(S^{2}) \cong \mathbb{R}$. Higher-degree harmonics correspond to exact/co-exact components of forms.</p>
<p>The harmonic functions on a compact manifold are exactly the constants, reflecting the fact that $H^{0}(M) \cong \mathbb{R}$ for connected manifolds. This is a special case of the Hodge theorem: the dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms equals the $k$-th Betti number.</p>
<h2>Challenge Problems</h2>
<p>The following problems synthesize the concepts of exterior calculus, cohomology, and Hodge theory.</p>
<h3>Challenge 1: The Poincaré Lemma and Contractibility</h3>
<p>The Poincaré lemma states that on a contractible manifold, every closed form is exact. Prove this for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by constructing an explicit homotopy operator $H: \Omega^{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) \to \Omega^{k-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $dH + Hd = \text{id}$ on forms with compact support.</p>
<p>Use this to show that $H^{k}_{\text{dR}}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) = 0$ for $k > 0$, and explain why this fails for the punctured plane $\mathbb{R}^{2} \setminus \{0\}$.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use radial coordinates and integrate along rays from the origin. The homotopy operator is $H\omega = \int_0^1 t^{k-1} \iota_{X} \omega(tx) \, dt$ where $X$ is the radial vector field.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

On $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, define the homotopy operator $H: \Omega^{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) \to \Omega^{k-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by

$$H\omega = \int_0^1 t^{k-1} \iota_{r\partial_r} \omega(tx) \, dt$$

where $\iota_{r\partial_r}$ is the interior product with the radial vector field $r\partial_r = \sum_i x^i \partial_i$.

For a closed form $\omega$ with $d\omega = 0$, we compute:

$$d(H\omega) = \int_0^1 t^{k-1} d(\iota_{r\partial_r} \omega(tx)) \, dt$$

Using Cartan's magic formula $\mathcal{L}_{r\partial_r} = d\iota_{r\partial_r} + \iota_{r\partial_r}d$ and the fact that $\mathcal{L}_{r\partial_r}\omega(tx) = k\omega(tx)$ (since $\omega$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ in the scaling), we get:

$$d(H\omega) = \int_0^1 t^{k-1} (k\omega(tx) - \iota_{r\partial_r} d\omega(tx)) \, dt = \int_0^1 k t^{k-1} \omega(tx) \, dt$$

On the other hand, $H(d\omega) = 0$ since $\omega$ is closed. Therefore:

$$(dH + Hd)\omega = d(H\omega) = \int_0^1 k t^{k-1} \omega(tx) \, dt$$

Changing variables $s = t$, $u = sx$, we get $\int_0^1 k t^{k-1} \omega(tx) \, dt = \omega(x)$, so $dH + Hd = \text{id}$.

This shows that every closed form $\omega$ satisfies $\omega = d(H\omega)$, so $\omega$ is exact. Therefore $H^{k}_{\text{dR}}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) = 0$ for $k > 0$.

For $\mathbb{R}^{2} \setminus \{0\}$, the 1-form $\alpha = (x\,dy - y\,dx)/(x^2 + y^2)$ is closed but not exact. The homotopy operator construction fails because $\mathbb{R}^{2} \setminus \{0\}$ is not contractible: we cannot continuously shrink it to a point while staying in the space. The cohomology class $[\alpha]$ represents the "winding number" around the origin, a topological invariant that cannot be removed by a smooth deformation.

</details>

<h3>Challenge 2: Hodge Decomposition and Elliptic PDEs</h3>
<p>The Hodge decomposition provides a complete characterization of when the equation $\Delta \eta = \omega$ is solvable. Show that for a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, the equation $\Delta \eta = \omega$ has a solution if and only if $\omega$ is orthogonal to all harmonic forms in the $L^2$ inner product.</p>
<p>Use this to solve $\Delta f = g$ on $S^{2}$ with the condition that $g$ has zero mean, and show that the solution is unique up to an additive constant.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use the fact that harmonic forms are exactly the kernel of $\Delta$, and apply the Fredholm alternative from Chapter 2.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

The Hodge Laplacian $\Delta = d\delta + \delta d$ is a self-adjoint elliptic operator on $\Omega^{k}(M)$. By the Hodge decomposition theorem, we have the orthogonal decomposition:

$$\Omega^{k}(M) = \mathcal{H}^{k} \oplus d\Omega^{k-1}(M) \oplus \delta\Omega^{k+1}(M)$$

where $\mathcal{H}^{k} = \ker \Delta$ is the space of harmonic forms.

If $\Delta \eta = \omega$ has a solution, then for any harmonic form $h \in \mathcal{H}^{k}$:

$$(\omega, h) = (\Delta \eta, h) = (\eta, \Delta h) = (\eta, 0) = 0$$

since $\Delta$ is self-adjoint and $h$ is harmonic. Therefore $\omega$ must be orthogonal to $\mathcal{H}^{k}$.

Conversely, if $\omega \perp \mathcal{H}^{k}$, then by the Hodge decomposition, $\omega = d\alpha + \delta\beta$ for some $\alpha \in \Omega^{k-1}(M)$ and $\beta \in \Omega^{k+1}(M)$. Since $\omega$ is orthogonal to harmonic forms, it has no harmonic component.

We claim that $\eta = \delta\beta$ solves $\Delta \eta = \omega$. Indeed:

$$\Delta(\delta\beta) = (d\delta + \delta d)(\delta\beta) = d\delta^2\beta + \delta d\delta\beta = \delta d\delta\beta$$

Since $\delta\beta$ is co-exact and $\omega$ has no harmonic part, we have $\delta d\delta\beta = \omega$, so $\Delta(\delta\beta) = \omega$.

For $S^{2}$, harmonic 0-forms are constants, so $\Delta f = g$ is solvable if and only if $\int_{S^{2}} g \, dV = 0$ (zero mean condition). The solution is unique up to an additive constant because the kernel of $\Delta$ on functions consists of constants.

This demonstrates the power of the Hodge decomposition: it reduces the solvability of elliptic PDEs to a simple orthogonality condition with harmonic forms, providing a complete answer to the question of when $\Delta \eta = \omega$ has a solution.

<h3>Challenge 3: Maxwell's Equations and Hodge Theory</h3>
<p>Express Maxwell's equations in the language of exterior calculus on Minkowski space, and use Hodge theory to show that the electromagnetic field $F$ can be written as $F = dA$ for a 1-form $A$ (the vector potential) if and only if $dF = 0$.</p>
<p>Show that $A$ is not unique: if $A$ and $A'$ both satisfy $F = dA = dA'$, then $A' = A + d\chi$ for some function $\chi$. This gauge freedom reflects the fact that $H^{1}_{\text{dR}}(\mathbb{R}^{4}) = 0$.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use the Poincaré lemma for the Minkowski metric, and show that the gauge transformation corresponds to adding an exact form.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

On Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ with metric $ds^{2} = -dt^{2} + dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}$, the electromagnetic field is a 2-form:

$$F = E_{i} \, dt \wedge dx^{i} + \tfrac{1}{2} \epsilon_{ijk} B^{k} \, dx^{i} \wedge dx^{j}$$

Maxwell's equations are $dF = 0$ (source-free) and $\delta F = 0$ (with appropriate current sources).

If $F = dA$ for some 1-form $A$, then automatically $dF = d^{2}A = 0$ by the property $d^{2} = 0$. Conversely, if $dF = 0$, then by the Poincaré lemma (which holds on contractible spaces like $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$), there exists a 1-form $A$ such that $F = dA$.

The 1-form $A$ is called the vector potential. In coordinates, if $A = A_{0} dt + A_{i} dx^{i}$, then $F = dA$ gives:

$$E_{i} = -\partial_{i}A_{0} - \partial_{t}A_{i}, \qquad B^{k} = \epsilon^{ijk}\partial_{i}A_{j}$$

which are the standard expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in terms of the vector and scalar potentials.

The gauge freedom arises because if $F = dA = dA'$, then $d(A' - A) = 0$, so $A' - A$ is closed. By the Poincaré lemma again, $A' - A = d\chi$ for some function $\chi$. Therefore $A' = A + d\chi$, and the transformation $A \mapsto A + d\chi$ is called a gauge transformation.

This gauge freedom reflects the fact that the physical field $F$ is determined by $A$ only up to an exact form. The function $\chi$ is not physically observable, but different choices of $\chi$ (different gauges) can simplify calculations. Common choices include the Lorenz gauge $\delta A = 0$ and the Coulomb gauge (for static problems) where the spatial part of $A$ is divergence-free.

The fact that $H^{1}_{\text{dR}}(\mathbb{R}^{4}) = 0$ (by the Poincaré lemma) ensures that every closed 1-form is exact, which is why we can always write $A' - A = d\chi$. On a space with nontrivial first cohomology, there would be additional topological obstructions to gauge transformations.

</details>

<p>The exterior calculus framework provides a coordinate-free language for differential equations on manifolds, revealing the topological structure underlying PDEs. However, this framework is primarily suited for elliptic and parabolic equations. The hyperbolic systems of Sections 3.2 and 3.3 require different techniques, while the geometric methods of Section 3.5 and the asymptotic analysis of Section 3.6 extend the exterior calculus to more complex physical systems.</p>
