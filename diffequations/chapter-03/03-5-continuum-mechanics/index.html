    <blockquote>
<p>The material body itself is the manifold: deformation is geometry, and frame indifference is the symmetry that selects physically meaningful energy functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The geometric machinery developed in previous sections—manifolds, covariant derivatives, and exterior calculus—finds its most immediate physical realization in continuum mechanics. Here, the manifold is not merely a background stage but represents the matter itself. A material body is modeled as a differential manifold, and its motion is a time-dependent embedding into ambient space. This formulation demonstrates that the partial differential equations of physics are constrained not just by conservation laws, but by the intrinsic geometry of deformation and the invariance of energy under rigid body rotations.</p>
<h2>Configuration Spaces and Kinematics</h2>
<p>We formalize the motion of a continuum by distinguishing between the <strong>reference configuration</strong>, denoted by $\Omega_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (coordinates $X$), and the <strong>current configuration</strong>, denoted by $\Omega_t \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (coordinates $x$). The motion is described by a smooth map $\varphi: \Omega_0 \times [0, T] \to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $x = \varphi(X,t)$ represents the position at time $t$ of the particle originally at $X$. The fundamental local descriptor of deformation is the <strong>deformation gradient</strong> $F$, defined as the tangent map of $\varphi$ with respect to the reference coordinates:</p>
$$
F(X,t) = D_X \varphi(X,t), \quad F_{i\alpha} = \frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial X_\alpha}.
$$

<p>To ensure the physical admissibility of the deformation—specifically, that the material does not interpenetrate or invert its orientation—we impose the Jacobian constraint $J = \det F > 0$ everywhere. This local condition ensures that $\varphi(\cdot, t)$ is a local diffeomorphism, preserving the orientation of the volume form. The evolution of the volume element is governed by Euler's transport theorem, which states that an infinitesimal volume $dX$ in the reference configuration maps to $dx = J dX$ in the current configuration.</p>
<h2>Strain Measures</h2>
<p>The concept of strain arises from the change in the metric tensor induced by the deformation. The ambient space is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. We can pull back the metric from the current configuration to the reference configuration via $\varphi^*$. The result is the <strong>Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor</strong>, denoted by $C$:</p>
$$
C = F^T F, \quad C_{\alpha\beta} = \sum_i F_{i\alpha} F_{i\beta}.
$$

<p>Geometrically, $C$ measures how the inner product of tangent vectors in the reference configuration changes after deformation. If the body undergoes a rigid rotation, $F$ is an orthogonal matrix, and $C = I$. Therefore, strain is defined as the deviation of $C$ from the identity. The <strong>Green-Lagrange strain tensor</strong> is defined as:</p>
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}(C - I).
$$

<p>This measure is non-linear in $\varphi$. In the regime of small deformations, where $\varphi(X) = X + u(X)$ for a small displacement field $u$, one linearizes this tensor to obtain the infinitesimal strain tensor $\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T)$, which forms the basis of linear elasticity covered in Evans (2010). However, large-deformation theory requires the full geometric nonlinearity of $E$.</p>
<p><strong>Canonical Neo-Hookean Material</strong></p>
<p>Consider a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material undergoing uniaxial extension. The reference configuration is a unit cube $\Omega_0 = [0,1]^3$. The deformation is:</p>
$$
\varphi(X_1, X_2, X_3, t) = \left(\lambda(t) X_1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda(t)}} X_2, \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda(t)}} X_3\right),
$$

<p>where $\lambda(t) > 0$ is the stretch ratio in the $X_1$-direction.</p>
<p>The deformation gradient is $F = D_X \varphi = \text{diag}(\lambda, \lambda^{-1/2}, \lambda^{-1/2})$. The Jacobian is $J = \det F = \lambda \cdot \lambda^{-1/2} \cdot \lambda^{-1/2} = 1$, confirming volume preservation for this incompressible material.</p>
<p>The Right Cauchy-Green tensor is $C = F^T F = \text{diag}(\lambda^2, \lambda^{-1}, \lambda^{-1})$, and the Green-Lagrange strain is $E = \frac{1}{2}(C - I) = \frac{1}{2}\text{diag}(\lambda^2 - 1, \lambda^{-1} - 1, \lambda^{-1} - 1)$.</p>
<p>For the neo-Hookean energy $W(F) = \frac{\mu}{2}(I_1 - 3) - \mu \ln J + \frac{\kappa}{2}(J - 1)^2$ with $I_1 = \text{tr}(C) = \lambda^2 + 2\lambda^{-1}$, the incompressible case ($J=1$) gives $W(\lambda) = \frac{\mu}{2}(\lambda^2 + 2\lambda^{-1} - 3)$.</p>
<p>The First Piola-Kirchhoff stress is $P_{11} = \frac{\partial W}{\partial \lambda} = \mu(\lambda - \lambda^{-2})$, and the Cauchy stress is $\sigma_{11} = P_{11} \lambda = \mu(\lambda^2 - \lambda^{-1})$. The stress-strain curve shows cubic growth for large $\lambda$, characteristic of nonlinear elasticity.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the geometric structure of finite deformation: the deformation gradient encodes the local geometry, the Cauchy-Green tensor measures strain invariantly under rotations, and the energy function determines the stress response through differentiation.</p>
<h2>Stress Tensors and Conservation Laws</h2>
<p>Forces within the continuum are described by stress tensors. The definition of stress depends entirely on whether the force is measured per unit area of the deformed (current) configuration or the reference configuration.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cauchy stress tensor</strong> $\sigma$ (symmetric) represents the force per unit area in the current configuration $\Omega_t$. The conservation of linear momentum in the Eulerian (spatial) frame is given by:</p>
$$
\rho \dot{v} = \text{div}_x \sigma + f,
$$

<p>where $\rho$ is the density and $f$ is the body force. However, for PDE analysis, it is often necessary to formulate the problem on the fixed reference domain $\Omega_0$. We define the <strong>First Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor</strong> $P$, which represents the force acting on the deformed surface element but measured per unit area of the reference configuration. It relates to $\sigma$ via the Piola transform:</p>
$$
P = J \sigma F^{-T}.
$$

<p>The conservation of momentum equation pulls back to the reference domain as:</p>
$$
\text{Div}_X P + f_0 = \rho_0 \ddot{\varphi},
$$

<p>where $\rho_0$ is the reference density. While $P$ is physically useful, it is generally not symmetric ($P \neq P^T$). To restore symmetry, we define the <strong>Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor</strong> $S$, which pulls the force vector itself back to the reference frame:</p>
$$
S = F^{-1} P = J F^{-1} \sigma F^{-T}.
$$

$S$
<p>is symmetric and fully defined on the reference configuration, making it the conjugate variable to the Green-Lagrange strain  in variational formulations.</p>
<p><strong>Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff Material</strong></p>
<p>Solve the static equilibrium of a Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff material under uniaxial tension. The energy density is $W(F) = \frac{\lambda}{2}(\text{tr} E)^2 + \mu \| E \|^2$.</p>
<p>The Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is $S = \frac{\partial W}{\partial E} = \lambda(\text{tr} E) I + 2\mu E$. For uniaxial extension $F = \text{diag}(\lambda, \lambda^{-1/2}, \lambda^{-1/2})$ with incompressibility, the Green-Lagrange strain components are $E_{11} = \frac{1}{2}(\lambda^2 - 1)$ and $E_{22} = E_{33} = \frac{1}{2}(\lambda^{-1} - 1)$.</p>
<p>The trace is $\text{tr} E = \frac{1}{2}(\lambda^2 + 2\lambda^{-1} - 3)$, so $S_{11} = \lambda \cdot \text{tr} E + 2\mu E_{11} = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2}(\lambda^2 + 2\lambda^{-1} - 3) + \mu(\lambda^2 - 1)$.</p>
<p>The First Piola-Kirchhoff stress is $P_{11} = F_{11} S_{11} = \lambda[\frac{\lambda}{2}(\lambda^2 + 2\lambda^{-1} - 3) + \mu(\lambda^2 - 1)]$. Linearizing with $\lambda = 1 + \varepsilon$ for small strains gives $P_{11} \approx (\lambda + 2\mu)\varepsilon$, matching linear elasticity with Young's modulus $E = \frac{\mu(3\lambda + 2\mu)}{\lambda + \mu}$.</p>
<p>The Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff model provides a bridge between linear and nonlinear elasticity: it uses the Green-Lagrange strain (nonlinear in displacement) but a quadratic energy (linear stress-strain relation in strain). This model is useful for moderate deformations but fails for large strains where material nonlinearity becomes important.</p>
<h2>Hyperelasticity and Frame Indifference</h2>
<p>A material is <strong>hyperelastic</strong> if its stress response is derived from a stored energy density function $W(F)$, such that the First Piola-Kirchhoff stress is given by $P(F) = \frac{\partial W}{\partial F}$. The equation of motion becomes a nonlinear system of PDEs:</p>
$$
\rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} = \text{Div} \left( \frac{\partial W}{\partial F}(\nabla \varphi) \right) + f_0.
$$

<p>The geometric nature of the material imposes strict constraints on the functional form of $W$. The principle of <strong>Frame Indifference</strong> (or Objectivity) states that the internal energy of a material should not change under superposed rigid body rotations of the current configuration. Formally, for any rotation $Q \in SO(n)$, we must have:</p>
$$
W(QF) = W(F).
$$

<p>This symmetry implies that $W$ cannot depend arbitrarily on $F$; it must depend only on the invariants of $U = \sqrt{F^T F}$, or equivalently, on the Right Cauchy-Green tensor $C = F^T F$. Thus, we may write $W(F) = \hat{W}(C)$.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Shear—Frame Indifference Verification</strong></p>
<p>Verify frame indifference for simple shear deformation $\varphi(X_1, X_2, X_3) = (X_1 + \gamma X_2, X_2, X_3)$.</p>
<p>The deformation gradient is $F = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and the Right Cauchy-Green tensor is $C = F^T F = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \gamma & 0 \\ \gamma & 1 + \gamma^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.</p>
<p>The principal invariants are $I_1 = \text{tr} C = 3 + \gamma^2$, $I_2 = 2 + \gamma^2$, and $I_3 = \det C = 1$.</p>
<p>Applying a rotation $Q$ to the current configuration gives $F' = QF$. The new Right Cauchy-Green tensor is $C' = F'^T F' = F^T Q^T Q F = F^T F = C$, so $W(F') = \hat{W}(C') = \hat{W}(C) = W(F)$, confirming frame indifference.</p>
<p>For a neo-Hookean material, $W = \frac{\mu}{2}(I_1 - 3) = \frac{\mu}{2}\gamma^2$, and the shear stress is $\sigma_{12} = \mu\gamma^3$, showing cubic growth with shear amount.</p>
<p>Frame indifference is a fundamental physical principle: the energy stored in a material should not depend on how we choose to orient our coordinate system. This symmetry reduces the functional form of $W$ from depending on the full deformation gradient to depending only on its invariants, dramatically simplifying the theory.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Plane Shear—Exact Nonlinear Solution</strong></p>
<p>Solve the anti-plane shear problem for a neo-Hookean material with deformation $\varphi(X_1, X_2, X_3) = (X_1, X_2, w(X_1, X_2))$.</p>
<p>The deformation gradient is $F = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ w_1 & w_2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and the Cauchy-Green tensor has components $C_{11} = 1 + w_1^2$, $C_{22} = 1 + w_2^2$, $C_{12} = w_1 w_2$, etc.</p>
<p>The first invariant is $I_1 = 3 + \vert \nabla w \vert^2$ and $I_3 = 1$. For static equilibrium with no body forces, $\text{Div} P = 0$ reduces to $\Delta w = 0$. The nonlinear problem reduces to Laplace's equation!</p>
<p>For a circular hole in an infinite plate, the solution is $w(r, \theta) = A\theta$ for $r > a$, giving pure azimuthal shear around the hole with $w_r = 0$ and $w_\theta = A/r$.</p>
<p>This remarkable result shows that for anti-plane shear, the geometric nonlinearity of finite deformation does not affect the equilibrium equation: it remains Laplace's equation, just as in linear elasticity. This is a special case where the nonlinearity cancels out, providing an exact solution to a fully nonlinear problem.</p>
<p><strong>Mooney-Rivlin Material—Complete Stress Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Compute the complete stress state for equibiaxial stretching of a Mooney-Rivlin material with energy $W(F) = C_1(I_1 - 3) + C_2(I_2 - 3)$.</p>
<p>For deformation $F = \text{diag}(\lambda, \lambda, \lambda^{-2})$, the invariants are $I_1 = 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^{-4}$ and $I_2 = 2\lambda^{-2} + \lambda^4$.</p>
<p>The Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is $S = 2[\frac{\partial W}{\partial I_1} + I_1 \frac{\partial W}{\partial I_2}] I - 2\frac{\partial W}{\partial I_2} C$ with $\frac{\partial W}{\partial I_1} = C_1$ and $\frac{\partial W}{\partial I_2} = C_2$.</p>
<p>The diagonal stress components are $S_{11} = S_{22} = 2(C_1 + C_2)(\lambda^2 - \lambda^{-4})$, and the Cauchy stress is $\sigma_{11} = \lambda^2 S_{11} = 2\lambda^2(C_1 + C_2)(\lambda^2 - \lambda^{-4})$.</p>
<p>With $C_1 = 0.3$ and $C_2 = 0.12$ MPa, the stress values are: $\sigma_{11}(1.0) = 0$, $\sigma_{11}(1.2) = 0.374$ MPa, $\sigma_{11}(1.5) = 1.134$ MPa, and $\sigma_{11}(2.0) = 3.456$ MPa.</p>
<p>The Mooney-Rivlin model is widely used for rubber-like materials because it captures both the first and second invariants of the deformation, providing better agreement with experimental data than the neo-Hookean model for biaxial loading.</p>
<p><strong>Thick-Walled Tube Under Pressure</strong></p>
<p>Solve the thick-walled tube problem for a neo-Hookean material with geometry $a \leq R \leq b$, internal pressure $P_i$, and external pressure $P_o = 0$.</p>
<p>For radial deformation $\varphi(R) = r(R)$ with $F = \frac{dr}{dR}$ and $\lambda_\theta = \frac{r}{R}$, incompressibility gives $r^2 - a^2 = R^2 - a^2$, so $r = \sqrt{R^2 + c}$.</p>
<p>The equilibrium equation is $\frac{d}{dR}(r\sigma_{rr}) = \sigma_{\theta\theta}\frac{dr}{dR}$, and the stress components are $\sigma_{rr} = \mu(1 - (R/r)^2)$ and $\sigma_{\theta\theta} = \mu(1 + (R/r)^2)$.</p>
<p>Applying boundary conditions $\sigma_{rr}(a) = -P_i$ and $\sigma_{rr}(b) = 0$ gives the pressure relation $P_i = \mu[1 - (a/b)^2 + \ln(b^2/a^2)]$.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how geometric constraints (incompressibility) and boundary conditions determine the deformation and stress fields in a fully nonlinear setting. The logarithmic term in the pressure relation is a signature of finite deformation, absent in linear elasticity.</p>
<p>The mathematical well-posedness of these equations relies on convexity. However, strict convexity of $W$ in the variable $F$ is physically unacceptable because it prohibits buckling and is incompatible with frame indifference. As discussed extensively in Evans (2010), the appropriate condition for existence of minimizers is <strong>polyconvexity</strong>. A function $W(F)$ is polyconvex if it can be written as a convex function of the minors of $F$. For $n=3$, this requires $W(F) = g(F, \text{cof } F, \det F)$ where $g$ is convex. This formulation reconciles the geometric requirements of frame indifference with the analytic requirements of the direct method in the calculus of variations, providing a rigorous existence theory for nonlinear elastostatics.</p>
<p><strong>Polyconvexity Verification for Ogden Material</strong></p>
<p>Verify polyconvexity for the Ogden material model $W(F) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{2\mu_i}{\alpha_i^2}(\lambda_1^{\alpha_i} + \lambda_2^{\alpha_i} + \lambda_3^{\alpha_i} - 3)$ where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are the principal stretches (eigenvalues of $U = \sqrt{C}$).</p>
<p>Each term $\lambda_k^{\alpha_i}$ is a convex function of $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$ when $\alpha_i > 1$. The polyconvex representation is $\phi(F, \text{cof } F, J) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{2\mu_i}{\alpha_i^2}(\lambda_1^{\alpha_i} + \lambda_2^{\alpha_i} + \lambda_3^{\alpha_i} - 3)$.</p>
<p>Hessian computation for each term shows positive definiteness, confirming that $W$ is polyconvex. This guarantees existence of minimizers by the direct method of the calculus of variations.</p>
<p>Polyconvexity is the mathematical condition that bridges geometry and analysis: it respects frame indifference (through dependence on invariants) while providing the convexity needed for existence theory. This is essential for proving that boundary value problems in nonlinear elasticity have solutions.</p>
<h2>Challenge Problems</h2>
<p>The following problems synthesize the concepts of deformation, stress, and frame indifference.</p>
<h3>Challenge 1: Frame Indifference and Material Symmetry</h3>
<p>Frame indifference requires $W(QF) = W(F)$ for all rotations $Q$. However, many materials also possess <strong>material symmetry</strong>: the energy is invariant under certain rotations of the reference configuration.</p>
<p>Show that if a material is isotropic (symmetric under all rotations of the reference configuration), then $W(F) = \hat{W}(I_1, I_2, I_3)$ where $I_1, I_2, I_3$ are the principal invariants of $C = F^T F$. Derive the explicit form of the stress tensor for an isotropic material.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use the fact that for an isotropic material, $W(FQ) = W(F)$ for all rotations $Q$, and combine this with frame indifference to show that $W$ depends only on the eigenvalues of $C$.)</em></p>
$E$<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

Frame indifference requires $W(QF) = W(F)$ for all rotations $Q$, which implies $W(F) = \hat{W}(C)$ where $C = F^T F$.

Material isotropy requires $W(FQ) = W(F)$ for all rotations $Q$ of the reference configuration. Since $C = F^T F$, we have $(FQ)^T(FQ) = Q^T F^T F Q = Q^T C Q$. Material isotropy then requires $\hat{W}(Q^T C Q) = \hat{W}(C)$ for all rotations $Q$.

This means $\hat{W}$ is invariant under orthogonal similarity transformations of $C$, so it depends only on the eigenvalues of $C$, or equivalently, on the principal invariants $I_1 = \text{tr} C$, $I_2 = \frac{1}{2}[(\text{tr} C)^2 - \text{tr}(C^2)]$, and $I_3 = \det C$.

Therefore, $W(F) = \hat{W}(I_1, I_2, I_3)$ for an isotropic material.

To derive the stress, we compute $P = \frac{\partial W}{\partial F}$. Using the chain rule and the fact that $\frac{\partial I_k}{\partial F} = \frac{\partial I_k}{\partial C} \frac{\partial C}{\partial F}$:

$$P = 2F \left[ \frac{\partial \hat{W}}{\partial I_1} I + \frac{\partial \hat{W}}{\partial I_2}(I_1 I - C) + \frac{\partial \hat{W}}{\partial I_3} I_3 C^{-1} \right]$$

This shows that for an isotropic material, the stress depends on $F$ only through $C$ and its invariants, with the specific form determined by the derivatives of $\hat{W}$ with respect to the invariants.

</details>

<h3>Challenge 2: Buckling and Loss of Uniqueness</h3>
<p>Linear elasticity predicts a unique solution for boundary value problems under reasonable conditions. However, nonlinear elasticity can exhibit <strong>buckling</strong>: multiple equilibrium configurations for the same boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Consider a neo-Hookean column under compressive load. Show that for sufficiently large loads, the straight configuration becomes unstable and buckled configurations appear. Relate this to the failure of convexity of the energy function.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Consider a one-dimensional model and compute the second variation of the energy. Buckling occurs when the second variation becomes indefinite.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

For a one-dimensional column of length $L$ under compressive load $P$, the deformation is $\varphi(X) = X + u(X)$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(L) = -\delta$ (prescribed end shortening).

The deformation gradient is $F = 1 + u'$, and for an incompressible neo-Hookean material, the energy is $W = \frac{\mu}{2}[(1 + u')^2 + (1 + u')^{-2} - 2]$ (accounting for the constraint that the cross-sectional area must vary to maintain volume).

The total energy is $\mathcal{E}[u] = \int_0^L W(1 + u') dX - P\delta$.

The straight configuration $u(X) = -\delta X/L$ (uniform compression) is an equilibrium. To check stability, we compute the second variation:

$$\delta^2 \mathcal{E}[\eta] = \int_0^L W''(1 + u') (\eta')^2 dX$$

For the straight configuration, $1 + u' = 1 - \delta/L = \lambda$. Computing $W''(\lambda) = \mu[1 + 3\lambda^{-4}]$, we see that $W'' > 0$ for all $\lambda > 0$, so the straight configuration is always a local minimum for the one-dimensional model.

However, for a two- or three-dimensional column, lateral buckling modes appear. The second variation becomes indefinite when there exists a perturbation $\eta$ (representing lateral deflection) such that $\delta^2 \mathcal{E}[\eta] < 0$.

This occurs when the compressive stress exceeds a critical value, related to the Euler buckling load. The loss of positive definiteness of the second variation corresponds to the failure of the energy to be strictly convex, even though it may be polyconvex.

This demonstrates that polyconvexity (needed for existence) does not imply uniqueness: multiple equilibrium configurations can coexist, reflecting the physical phenomenon of buckling.

</details>

<h3>Challenge 3: Incompressibility and Lagrange Multipliers</h3>
<p>Incompressible materials satisfy $J = \det F = 1$ everywhere. This constraint can be enforced using Lagrange multipliers in the variational formulation.</p>
<p>Show that for an incompressible hyperelastic material, the First Piola-Kirchhoff stress takes the form $P = \frac{\partial W}{\partial F} - p F^{-T}$ where $p$ is a Lagrange multiplier (the pressure). Derive the equilibrium equations and show that $p$ is determined by the boundary conditions and the incompressibility constraint.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers in the variational principle, and show that the constraint $J = 1$ leads to the pressure term.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

For an incompressible material, we minimize the energy $\mathcal{E}[\varphi] = \int_{\Omega_0} W(F) dX$ subject to the constraint $J = \det F = 1$ everywhere.

Using Lagrange multipliers, we form the augmented functional:

$$\mathcal{L}[\varphi, p] = \int_{\Omega_0} [W(F) - p(J - 1)] dX$$

where $p(X)$ is the Lagrange multiplier field.

Taking the first variation with respect to $\varphi$:

$$\delta \mathcal{L} = \int_{\Omega_0} \left[ \frac{\partial W}{\partial F} : \delta F - p \frac{\partial J}{\partial F} : \delta F \right] dX$$

Using the identity $\frac{\partial J}{\partial F} = J F^{-T}$, and the fact that $J = 1$ for incompressible materials:

$$\delta \mathcal{L} = \int_{\Omega_0} \left[ \frac{\partial W}{\partial F} - p F^{-T} \right] : \delta F dX$$

For equilibrium, this must vanish for all admissible variations, so:

$$P = \frac{\partial W}{\partial F} - p F^{-T}$$

The equilibrium equation is $\text{Div} P + f_0 = \rho_0 \ddot{\varphi}$, and the incompressibility constraint $J = 1$ must be satisfied.

The pressure $p$ is not given by a constitutive relation but is determined by the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions, subject to the constraint. This is analogous to the pressure in incompressible fluid mechanics: it's a reaction force that enforces the constraint, not a material property.

For the neo-Hookean material with $W = \frac{\mu}{2}(I_1 - 3)$, we have $\frac{\partial W}{\partial F} = \mu F$, so $P = \mu F - p F^{-T}$. The pressure adjusts to ensure that any volume change created by the deformation is exactly compensated, maintaining $J = 1$ everywhere.

</details>

<p>The theory of nonlinear elasticity provides a complete geometric framework for large deformations, but the analysis of these equations remains challenging. The polyconvexity condition ensures existence of solutions, but uniqueness can fail through buckling instabilities. The extension to dynamics, viscoelasticity, and plasticity requires additional physical principles beyond those developed here, connecting to the asymptotic methods of Section 3.6 and the numerical techniques of later chapters.</p>
