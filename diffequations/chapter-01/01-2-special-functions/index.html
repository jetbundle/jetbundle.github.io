            <section class="narrative-intro">
                <p>When elementary functions fail, we define new ones via differential equations. This is not a retreat
                    but an expansion: the universe of solutions is far richer than $\sin$, $\cos$, and $e^x$. The
                    <strong>Hypergeometric Master Equation</strong> stands as the Rosetta Stone, unifying what appears to
                    be a chaotic "zoo" of Bessel, Legendre, Hermite, and Whittaker functions into a single coherent
                    family. All classical special functions emerge as confluent limits, dictated by the geometric
                    placement of singularities on the Riemann sphere.</p>
                <p>We introduce the <strong>Frobenius Method</strong> to systematically extract power-series solutions near
                    regular singular points. This method transforms the problem of solving differential equations into the
                    algebraic problem of finding indicial roots and recurrence relations. For a moment, everything seems
                    under control: every singularity is classified, every solution is a convergent series, every function
                    is globally analytic.</p>
                <p>Then comes the <strong>Stokes Phenomenon</strong>: the devastating realization that asymptotic
                    expansions are not global. The analytic form of a solution jumps discontinuously across specific
                    rays in the complex plane. What appears as a single function is actually a multi-valued object
                    encoding topological information about the Riemann surface structure. The dream of global explicit
                    solutions dies here — but in its place, we discover something far more profound: the geometric
                    structure of the solution space itself.</p>

                <h2>The Hypergeometric Master Equation</h2>

                <p>The hypergeometric equation is the canonical second-order linear ODE with three regular singular
                    points on the Riemann sphere:</p>
                $$
                x(1-x)y''+[c-(a+b+1)x]y'-ab\,y=0.
                $$

                <div class="definition">
                    <p><strong>Gauss Hypergeometric Function:</strong> The solution to the hypergeometric equation is
                        defined by the power series</p>
                    $$
                    {}_2F_{1}(a,b;c;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(a)_{n}(b)_{n}}{(c)_{n}}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}, \qquad
                    (a)_{n}=\frac{\Gamma(a+n)}{\Gamma(a)},
                    $$
                    <p>where $(a)_n$ is the Pochhammer symbol. The series converges for $\vert x \vert < 1$ and extends
                        elsewhere by analytic continuation.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Transformations such as $x\mapsto 1-x$ or $x\mapsto 1/x$ permute the singular points and generate
                    Kummer's 24 solutions, highlighting the group structure of the solution space. This symmetry is not
                    accidental — it reflects the underlying geometric structure of the Riemann sphere.</p>

                <div class="example">
                    <p><strong>Hypergeometric Series Solution</strong></p>

                    <p>We seek $y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}$. Substituting gives the recurrence</p>
                    $$
                    a_{n}=\frac{n}{n+1}a_{n-1}=\frac{a_{0}}{n+1},
                    $$

                    <p>so</p>
                    $$
                    y(x)=a_{0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n+1}=-a_{0}\ln(1-x),
                    $$

                    <p>which matches</p>
                    $${}_2F_{1}(1,1;2;x)=-\frac{\ln(1-x)}{x}$$

                    <p>and demonstrates how power-series solutions encode hypergeometric behavior. This example reveals
                        that hypergeometric functions generalize elementary functions like logarithms, but the
                        convergence domain $\vert x \vert < 1$ is restrictive. Analytic continuation becomes necessary,
                        foreshadowing the Stokes phenomenon.</p>

                <h2>Confluent Limits and Classical Descendants</h2>

                <p>Merging singularities (confluence) produces equations with fewer regular singular points but
                    introduces irregular ones, creating the classical special functions. This geometric operation reveals
                    that the diversity of special functions is not arbitrary — it reflects the structure of singular
                    point configurations on the Riemann sphere.</p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <p><strong>Confluence Principle:</strong> All classical special functions arise as confluent limits
                        of the hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1$ by merging singular points. The Bessel, Legendre, and
                        Kummer functions are not separate families but different limiting behaviors of a single unified
                        structure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <p><strong>Bessel Functions as Confluent Limits</strong></p>
                    <p>Derive $J_{0}$ as a limit of the hypergeometric function ${}_2F_{1}$.</p>
                    <p>Start from the hypergeometric function ${}_2F_{1}(a,b;c;z)$ with $a=\nu/2$, $b=-\nu/2$,
                        $c=\nu+1$, and $z=-\frac{z^{2}}{c}$. Taking $c\to\infty$ gives</p>
                    $$
                    J_{\nu}(z)=\frac{(z/2)^{\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu+1)}\lim_{c\to\infty}{}_2F_{1}(\frac{\nu}{2},-\frac{\nu}{2};\nu+1;-\frac{z^{2}}{c}).
                    $$

                    <p>For $\nu=0$, the limit yields
                        $J_{0}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(k!)^{2}}(\frac{z}{2})^{2k}$, recovering the
                        Bessel series and illustrating confluence. The Bessel equation</p>
                    $$
                    x^{2}y''+xy'+(x^{2}-\nu^{2})y=0,
                    $$
                    <p>arises from the hypergeometric equation by letting $c\to \infty$ while scaling $x$ appropriately.
                    </p>

                <h2>Frobenius Method and Regular Singularities</h2>

                <div class="definition">
                    <p><strong>Regular Singular Point:</strong> For $y''+P(x)y'+Q(x)y=0$, a point $x_{0}$ is
                        <strong>regular singular</strong> if $(x-x_{0})P(x)$ and $(x-x_{0})^{2}Q(x)$ are analytic at
                        $x_0$. At such points, the Frobenius method proposes</p>
                    $$
                    y(x)=(x-x_{0})^{r}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(x-x_{0})^{n}, \qquad a_{0}\neq 0,
                    $$
                    <p>producing the indicial equation $r(r-1)+p_{0}r+q_{0}=0$ whose roots determine the local solution

                    monodromy. This classification system transforms the problem of solving differential equations into
                    the algebraic problem of understanding the structure of singular points.</p>

                    <p>This is Bessel's equation of order $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Frobenius yields the indicial equation
                        $r^{2}-\tfrac{1}{4}=0$, so $r=\pm\tfrac{1}{2}$. The first solution is
                        $y_{1}(x)=x^{1/2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!\Gamma(n+3/2)}(\frac{x}{2})^{2n}$; when
                        the roots differ by an integer, the second solution involves a logarithmic term
                        $y_{2}=y_{1}\ln x+\cdots$. These correspond to $J_{1/2}$ and $Y_{1/2}$, showing how Frobenius

                    asymptotic analysis. The transition from regular to irregular singularities marks the boundary
                    between power-series methods and the deeper geometric structure of the solution space.

                    <p>Show that the hypergeometric equation $x(1-x)y''+[c-(a+b+1)x]y'-ab\,y=0$ admits exactly 24
                        solutions related by transformations $x\mapsto 1-x$, $x\mapsto 1/x$, and parameter

                        <summary>Solution</summary>
                        <p>The three singular points at $x=0, 1, \infty$ can be permuted by Möbius transformations,
                            generating a group of 6 transformations. Each transformation can be combined with parameter
                            swaps $(a,b) \leftrightarrow (b,a)$ and the identity transformation, giving $6 \times 4 = 24$
                            solutions. These solutions form a complete set, and their connection formulas encode the
                            monodromy structure of the hypergeometric function.</p>

                    <p>Rigorously derive the Bessel equation from the hypergeometric equation by taking the confluent
                        limit $c\to\infty$ with appropriate scaling. Show that the indicial equation reduces to the
                        Bessel indicial equation, and verify that the series solution converges to the Bessel function
                        series.</p>

                            limit $c\to\infty$ requires careful scaling. The Pochhammer symbols $(c)_n$ in the
                            denominator grow as $c^n$, while the numerator terms scale appropriately. The resulting
                            series matches the Bessel function definition, and the differential equation reduces to
                            Bessel's equation through the confluence of singular points.</p>

                        expansions across the Stokes lines at $\arg x = \pm \pi/3$. Show how these multipliers encode the
                        monodromy of the solution around the irregular singular point at infinity.</p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Solution</summary>
                        <p>The Airy equation has an irregular singular point at infinity. WKB analysis reveals two
                            independent solutions with different exponential behaviors. Crossing the Stokes lines causes
                            the subdominant solution to "switch on" with a specific multiplier. These multipliers,
                            computed via Borel resummation or connection formulas, encode the global monodromy
                            structure. The discontinuity across Stokes lines is not a failure of the method but a
                            fundamental property of the solution's Riemann surface structure.</p>

            <!-- FINAL CLIFFHANGER – the single most important paragraph on the page -->
            <div class="cliffhanger final">
                <p>We have unified the "zoo" of special functions into a single hypergeometric family. We have
                    classified all singularities and extracted power-series solutions. We have discovered orthogonality
                    and completeness. But the Stokes phenomenon has revealed the fundamental truth: asymptotic expansions
                    are not global, and the analytic form of a solution jumps discontinuously across certain rays. The
                    dream of global explicit solutions is dead. What survives is the geometric structure of the solution
                    space itself — a structure that will require the full machinery of functional analysis to
                    understand. In the next section, we abandon explicit formulas entirely and embrace the infinite
                    series: integral transforms that encode solutions not as functions, but as their spectral
                    decompositions.</p>
