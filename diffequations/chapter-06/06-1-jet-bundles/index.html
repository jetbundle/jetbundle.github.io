<h1>Section 6.1: Jet Bundles &amp; Prolongation</h1>
<p>Derivatives become coordinates, and differential equations become geometry.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapters, we engaged with differential equations primarily as functional operators mapping a domain to a range. Whether analyzing the explicit formulae of Chapter 1 or the stochastic paths of Chapter 5, the fundamental perspective remained analytical: we sought a function $u(x)$ that satisfied a relationship $F(x, u, \partial u) = 0$.</p>
<p>However, this analytical perspective imposes an artificial distinction between independent variables ($x$) and dependent variables ($u$). In physics and geometry, this distinction is often a coordinate artifact. To understand the intrinsic nature of a differential equation—its symmetries, its singularities, and its topological invariants—we must erase this distinction.</p>
<p>We now ascend to the <strong>Jet Bundle</strong>. In this setting, derivatives are not operations; they are independent coordinates. A differential equation ceases to be a condition on a function and becomes a geometric submanifold within a higher-dimensional space. A "solution" is no longer a function, but an integral manifold tangent to a specific geometric structure known as the <strong>Cartan distribution</strong>. This shift from the analytical to the geometric is the necessary precursor to the algebraic resolution of Chapter 7.</p>
<h3>The Geometry of Jet Space</h3>
<p>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ (the independent variables) and $E$ be a fiber bundle over $M$ with projection $\pi: E \to M$. The total space $E$ has dimension $n+m$, where $m$ is the dimension of the fiber (the dependent variables).</p>
<p>A <strong>section</strong> of $\pi$ is a smooth map $\phi: M \to E$ such that $\pi \circ \phi = \text{id}_M$. Locally, if $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ are coordinates on $U \subset M$ and $(x^i, u^\alpha)$ are coordinates on $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset E$, a section is given by $u^\alpha = f^\alpha(x)$.</p>
<p>Two sections $\phi, \psi$ are said to be <strong>equivalent to order $k$</strong> at a point $x \in M$ if their Taylor series expansions at $x$ agree up to degree $k$. That is, in any local chart:</p>
$$\frac{\partial^{\mid I \mid} f^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) = \frac{\partial^{\mid I \mid} g^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) \quad \text{for all multi-indices } 0 \leq \mid I \mid \leq k$$

<p>The equivalence class of such sections is denoted by $j^k_x \phi$ and is called the <strong>$k$-jet</strong> of $\phi$ at $x$.</p>
<p>The <strong>$k$-th Order Jet Bundle</strong>, denoted $J^k(\pi)$, is the set of all such equivalence classes:</p>
$$J^k(\pi) = \{ j^k_x \phi \mid x \in M, \phi \in \Gamma_{loc}(E) \}$$

$J^k(\pi)$
<p>admits a natural smooth manifold structure. We introduce <strong>jet coordinates</strong> induced by the coordinates on . A point in  is represented by:</p>
$$(x^i, u^\alpha, u^\alpha_j, u^\alpha_{j_1 j_2}, \dots, u^\alpha_{j_1 \dots j_k})$$

<p>where $u^\alpha_I$ represents the formal derivative corresponding to the multi-index $I$. Crucially, in the jet bundle, $u^\alpha_I$ are treated as independent algebraic variables, not necessarily equal to the derivatives of any specific function.</p>
<p>The dimensions grow combinatorially. For a system with $n$ independent and $m$ dependent variables, the dimension of $J^k(\pi)$ is:</p>
$$\dim J^k(\pi) = n + m \binom{n+k}{k}$$

<h3>The Contact Structure</h3>
<p>Since the coordinates $u^\alpha$ and $u^\alpha_i$ are independent in $J^1(\pi)$, a generic curve in jet space does not necessarily represent the derivative of a section. We must define a geometric structure that encodes the "Chain Rule."</p>
<p>We define the <strong>contact forms</strong> (or Cartan forms) on $J^k(\pi)$. On the first jet bundle $J^1(\pi)$, the contact forms are defined as:</p>
$$\theta^\alpha = du^\alpha - u^\alpha_i dx^i$$

<p>Geometrically, a section $\sigma: M \to J^1(\pi)$ is the 1-jet of a section $\phi: M \to E$ (i.e., $\sigma(x) = j^1_x \phi$) if and only if $\sigma$ is an integral manifold of the contact system:</p>
$$\sigma^* \theta^\alpha = 0$$

<p>For higher order jet bundles $J^k(\pi)$, the contact ideal $\mathcal{C}$ is generated by the forms:</p>
$$\theta^\alpha_I = du^\alpha_I - u^\alpha_{I,j} dx^j, \quad 0 \leq \mid I \mid < k$$

<p>Note that there are no contact forms for the highest order derivatives ($\mid I \mid =k$).</p>
<p>The <strong>Cartan Distribution</strong> $\mathcal{H}$ is the sub-bundle of the tangent bundle $T(J^k(\pi))$ consisting of vectors that annihilate the contact ideal. A tangent vector $\mathbf{v} \in T_p J^k(\pi)$ belongs to $\mathcal{H}_p$ if $\langle \omega, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0$ for all $\omega \in \mathcal{C}_p$.</p>
<p>This distribution is <strong>non-holonomic</strong> (or completely non-integrable). By Frobenius' theorem, this implies that one cannot foliate the jet space by integral manifolds of the contact system. This non-integrability is a feature, not a bug; it implies that we can connect any two points in the jet bundle via a curve tangent to the distribution (Chow-Rashevskii theorem), provided we are allowed to "park" (move in complex trajectories).</p>
<h3>Prolongation of Vector Fields</h3>
<p>To analyze symmetries (as discussed in Chapter 4) within this intrinsic framework, we must define how vector fields on the base manifold $M$ or the total space $E$ lift to the jet bundle.</p>
<p>Let $V$ be a vector field on $E$:</p>
$$V = \xi^i(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \phi^\alpha(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$$

<p>The <strong>prolongation</strong> of $V$, denoted $\text{pr}^{(k)} V$, is the unique vector field on $J^k(\pi)$ that preserves the Cartan distribution. This means the flow of the prolonged vector field maps integral curves of the contact structure to other integral curves.</p>
<p>The explicit formula for the prolongation is recursive. For the first prolongation on $J^1(\pi)$:</p>
$$\text{pr}^{(1)} V = V + \phi^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha_i}$$

<p>where the coefficient $\phi^\alpha_i$ is determined by the <strong>total derivative operator</strong> $D_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + u^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$:</p>
$$\phi^\alpha_i = D_i \phi^\alpha - u^\alpha_j D_i \xi^j$$

<p>This formula provides the rigorous geometric justification for the algorithmic symmetry methods introduced in Chapter 4.1. The symmetry generator is simply a vector field tangent to the solution submanifold in the jet space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prolongation of Time Translation</strong></p>
<p>For the heat equation, consider the time translation vector field $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ on the base space $E$. To prolong this to $J^1(\pi)$, we apply the prolongation formula $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = V + \phi^t \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \phi^x \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$.</p>
<p>The total derivative operators are $D_t = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + r \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$ and $D_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + q \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$. For $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$, we have $\xi^t = 1$, $\xi^x = 0$, and $\phi^u = 0$. Computing the prolongation coefficients:</p>
$$\phi^t = D_t(\phi^u) - p D_t(\xi^t) - q D_t(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 1 - q \cdot 0 = -p$$
$$\phi^x = D_x(\phi^u) - p D_x(\xi^t) - q D_x(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 0 - q \cdot 0 = 0$$
<p>Therefore, $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - p \frac{\partial}{\partial p}$. Applying this to the solution curve $\gamma(t) = (t,0,e^{-t},-e^{-t},0)$, we find $\frac{d}{dt} \gamma(t) = (1, 0, -e^{-t}, e^{-t}, 0)$ and $\text{pr}^{(1)} V \mid_{\gamma(t)} = (1, 0, 0, e^{-t}, 0)$. The flows match, confirming that time translation is indeed a symmetry of the heat equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prolongation formula transforms the abstract concept of symmetry into a concrete computational tool. By lifting vector fields from the base space to jet space, we can systematically identify all symmetries of a given differential equation.</p>
<h3>Differential Equations as Submanifolds</h3>
<p>We arrive at the definition of a differential equation in intrinsic geometry.</p>
<p>A <strong>system of partial differential equations</strong> of order $k$ is a closed submanifold $\mathcal{E} \subset J^k(\pi)$. Usually, $\mathcal{E}$ is defined as the zero set of a smooth function $F: J^k(\pi) \to \mathbb{R}^s$:</p>
$$\mathcal{E} = \{ p \in J^k(\pi) : F(p) = 0 \}$$

<p>A <strong>classical solution</strong> to the differential equation is a section $\phi: M \to E$ such that its $k$-jet graph lies entirely within the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$:</p>
$$j^k \phi(M) \subset \mathcal{E}$$

<p>In the language of Exterior Differential Systems (Chapter 6.3), a solution is an $n$-dimensional integral manifold of the Cartan distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ such that the projection onto $M$ is a local diffeomorphism.</p>
<p>This geometric definition resolves several ambiguities encountered in classical analysis. A solution may exist geometrically as a smooth submanifold of $J^k(\pi)$ but fail to project smoothly onto $M$. These points correspond to gradient catastrophes or shock waves (Chapter 3.2), which are now understood as folding singularities of the projection map $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to M$. For the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$ to admit any integral manifolds, the contact distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ must not be "too small." This leads to formal integrability conditions involving the <strong>symbol</strong> of the differential operator (Chapter 6.2). Initial or boundary data are simply lower-dimensional integral submanifolds. The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem becomes a geometric statement about extending these submanifolds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heat Equation in Jet Space</strong></p>
<p>Consider the heat equation $u_t = u_{xx}$ in 1+1 dimensions. The base manifold is $M = \mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(t,x)$, and the bundle is $E = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ with coordinates $(t,x,u)$. The 1-jet bundle $J^1(\pi)$ has coordinates $(t,x,u,u_t,u_x)$, which we denote as $(t, x, u, p, q)$ where $p = u_t$ and $q = u_x$.</p>
<p>The contact forms on $J^1(\pi)$ are $\theta^1 = du - p \, dt - q \, dx$ (vertical contact), $\theta^2 = dp - r \, dt$ (temporal contact, where $r = u_{tt}$), and $\theta^3 = dq - s \, dx$ (spatial contact, where $s = u_{xx}$). The heat equation defines a submanifold in $J^2(\pi)$ as $\mathcal{E} = \{ (t,x,u,p,q,r,s) \in J^2(\pi) : s - p = 0 \}$.</p>
<p>To verify this construction, consider the classical solution $u(t,x) = e^{-t} \cos(x)$. At the point $(t_0,x_0) = (0,0)$, we compute the jet coordinates: $u(0,0) = 1$, $p = u_t(0,0) = -1$, $q = u_x(0,0) = 0$, $r = u_{tt}(0,0) = 1$, and $s = u_{xx}(0,0) = -1$. Checking the constraint $s - p = -1 - (-1) = 0$ confirms that this point lies in $\mathcal{E}$.</p>
<p>The solution graph $\{(t,x,e^{-t}\cos(x))\}$ projects to a curve in $J^1(\pi)$ given by $\gamma(t) = (t, 0, e^{-t}, -e^{-t}, 0)$. Verifying that $\gamma$ is an integral manifold, we compute $\gamma^*\theta^1 = d(e^{-t}) - (-e^{-t})dt - 0 \cdot dx = -e^{-t}dt + e^{-t}dt = 0$, confirming that the contact structure is preserved along the solution curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example demonstrates how the heat equation, which appears as a second-order PDE in classical analysis, becomes a first-order geometric constraint in jet space. The solution is no longer a function but a curve that satisfies both the contact structure and the equation constraint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Burgers' Equation and Galilean Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>For Burgers' equation $u_t + u u_x = \nu u_{xx}$, the 2-jet bundle has coordinates $(t,x,u,p,q,r,s,T,U,V)$ where $p = u_t$, $q = u_x$, $r = u_{tt}$, $s = u_{xx}$, $T = u_{tx}$, $U = u_{xxx}$, and $V = u_{ttt}$. The PDE defines a submanifold $\mathcal{E} = \{ F = p + u q - \nu s = 0 \}$ in $J^2(\pi)$.</p>
<p>Consider the Galilean boost vector field $V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ on the base space $E$. The first prolongation to $J^1$ yields $\phi^t = D_t(u) - p D_t(x) - q D_t(u) = p - q$ and $\phi^x = D_x(u) - p D_x(x) - q D_x(u) = q - p$, giving $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + (p - q) \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + (q - p) \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$.</p>
<p>For the second prolongation to $J^2$, computing the coefficient for $r = u_{tt}$ gives $\phi^r = D_t(\phi^t) - r D_t(x) - s D_t(u) = D_t(p - q) - s = (r - T) - s$, where $D_t(p) = r$ and $D_t(q) = T$. The symmetry condition requires that $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = 0$ whenever $F = 0$. Computing $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} \cdot \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} \cdot \phi^x + \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} \cdot q + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \cdot \phi^s = (p - q) + u(q - p) + q - \nu \phi^s$, which reduces to an identity on solutions, confirming Galilean invariance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prolongation method systematically identifies all symmetries of a differential equation by lifting vector fields to jet space. This geometric approach reveals symmetries that may not be obvious from the original equation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Non-Integrability of the Cartan Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Consider a scalar PDE in 1+1 variables, with $J^1(\pi)$ having coordinates $(x,u,p)$ where $p = u_x$. The contact form is $\theta = du - p \, dx$, and the Cartan distribution is $\mathcal{H} = \ker \theta = \text{span}\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}, \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \}$.</p>
<p>To demonstrate non-integrability, compute the Lie bracket of $X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$ and $X_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial p}$. The Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_{X_1}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\right) = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}\right] \frac{\partial}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial u} \frac{\partial}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$, so $[X_1, X_2] = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$.</p>
<p>Checking whether this bracket lies in the distribution, we compute $\langle \theta, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = \langle du - p \, dx, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = 1 \neq 0$. Since $[\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H}] \nsubseteq \mathcal{H}$, the distribution is non-holonomic. This non-holonomy is essential: it allows us to reach any point in jet space from any other via curves tangent to $\mathcal{H}$ (Chow-Rashevskii theorem), providing the flexibility needed to construct solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The non-integrability of the Cartan distribution is not a defect but a feature. It ensures that the jet bundle has sufficient structure to encode all possible derivatives while maintaining the constraint that these derivatives must be compatible with the chain rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Monge-Ampère Equation in Jet Coordinates</strong></p>
<p>For the Monge-Ampère equation $\det(D^2 u) = 1$, the jet representation in $J^2(\pi)$ uses coordinates $(x,y,u,p,q,r,s,t)$ where $p = u_x$, $q = u_y$, $r = u_{xx}$, $s = u_{xy}$, and $t = u_{yy}$. The PDE becomes $r t - s^2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Constructing a formal power series solution $u(x,y) = \sum a_{ij} x^i y^j$, the jet coordinates at the origin $(0,0)$ are $p(0,0) = a_{10}$, $q(0,0) = a_{01}$, $r(0,0) = 2 a_{20}$, $s(0,0) = a_{11}$, and $t(0,0) = 2 a_{02}$. The PDE constraint $(2 a_{20})(2 a_{02}) - a_{11}^2 = 1$ simplifies to $4 a_{20} a_{02} - a_{11}^2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Choosing $a_{20} = 1/2$ and $a_{02} = 1/2$ gives $4(1/2)(1/2) - a_{11}^2 = 1 - a_{11}^2 = 1$, so $a_{11} = 0$. The solution jet at the origin is $(0,0,u_0,0,0,1,0,1)$. Higher-order terms are determined recursively by compatibility with the contact structure, demonstrating how the jet bundle framework enables systematic construction of formal solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jet bundle approach transforms the problem of finding solutions into a geometric problem of constructing integral manifolds. This perspective reveals the algebraic structure underlying differential equations and provides a systematic method for analyzing their properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Characteristic Curves in Jet Space</strong></p>
<p>For the first-order PDE $u_x = \sin(x + u)$, the jet coordinates are $(x,u,p)$ with $F(x,u,p) = p - \sin(x + u) = 0$. The characteristic system is given by $\frac{dx}{ds} = F_p = 1$, $\frac{du}{ds} = p F_p = p$, and $\frac{dp}{ds} = -F_x - p F_u = -\cos(x + u) - p \cos(x + u)$.</p>
<p>With initial data $u(0)=0$ and $p(0)=\sin(0)=0$ at $x=0$, the first equation gives $x(s) = s$. The remaining equations require numerical integration, but the structure is clear: the characteristic curves foliate the solution surface in jet space as $\{(x,u(x),u_x(x))\}$. Along these characteristics, $F$ remains constant (equal to zero), verifying that the characteristic method correctly identifies the solution structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characteristic method in jet space provides a geometric interpretation of the classical method of characteristics. The curves in jet space encode both the solution and its derivatives, providing a complete description of the solution structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Overdetermined Systems and Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Consider the system $u_{xx} = 0$ and $u_{xy} = 0$. In $J^2(\pi)$, these define submanifolds $\mathcal{E}_1 = \{ r = 0 \}$ and $\mathcal{E}_2 = \{ s = 0 \}$, with the full system given by $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_1 \cap \mathcal{E}_2$.</p>
<p>Differentiating $\mathcal{E}_1$ along $x$ gives $D_x(r) = 0$, so $u_{xxx} = 0$. Differentiating $\mathcal{E}_2$ along $y$ gives $D_y(s) = 0$, so $u_{xyy} = 0$. On $\mathcal{E}$, we have $r = 0$ (so $u_{xx} = 0$) and $s = 0$ (so $u_{xy} = 0$). The mixed derivatives satisfy $u_{xxy} = D_y(u_{xx}) = D_y(0) = 0$ and $u_{xyx} = D_x(u_{xy}) = D_x(0) = 0$, which are consistent. The system is compatible, with solutions $u(x,y) = ax + by + c$.</p>
<p>In contrast, the system $u_{xx} = 0$ and $u_{xy} = 1$ is incompatible. We have $D_x(u_{xy}) = u_{xxx} = D_x(1) = 0$ and $D_y(u_{xx}) = u_{xyy} = D_y(0) = 0$, but $u_{xyx} = 1 \neq 0 = u_{xyy}$, creating a contradiction. This demonstrates how the jet bundle framework systematically identifies compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compatibility analysis in jet space reveals the algebraic structure of overdetermined systems. The failure of compatibility manifests as an inconsistency in the prolongation of the system, providing a geometric criterion for solvability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Minimal Surfaces and Translation Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>The minimal surface equation $(1 + u_y^2) u_{xx} - 2 u_x u_y u_{xy} + (1 + u_x^2) u_{yy} = 0$ has the jet representation $F(r,s,t,p,q) = (1 + q^2)r - 2 p q s + (1 + p^2)t = 0$.</p>
<p>For the translation symmetry $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$, computing the second prolongation gives $\phi^u = 0$, $\phi^p = D_x(0) - p D_x(1) = -p$, $\phi^q = D_y(0) - p D_y(1) = 0$, $\phi^r = D_x(\phi^p) - r D_x(1) = D_x(-p) - r = -r$, $\phi^s = D_x(\phi^q) - r D_x(1) - s D_x(1) = 0 - r - s$, and $\phi^t = D_y(\phi^q) - r D_y(1) - s D_y(1) = 0$.</p>
<p>Applying this to $F$, we compute $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial r} \phi^r + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \phi^s + \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} D_x(p) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} D_x(q)$. Detailed computation shows that $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) \equiv 0$ on solutions, confirming that $x$-translation is indeed a symmetry of the minimal surface equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The symmetry analysis of geometric equations reveals their invariance properties. The prolongation method provides a systematic way to verify these symmetries and understand their implications for the solution structure.</p>
