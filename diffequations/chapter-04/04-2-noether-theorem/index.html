      <h1>Section 4.2: Noether's Theorem & Invariant Reduction</h1>
      <p class="description">Symmetries yield conservation laws</p>
    </header>
    <article>
<p>Every differentiable symmetry of the action integral corresponds to a local conservation law, transforming the search for conserved quantities from ad hoc analysis into geometric classification.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>While the algorithmic determination of Lie symmetries, as detailed in the preceding section, provides a systematic method for reducing the order of differential equations, it does not immediately reveal the physical conservation laws that often motivate the study of such systems. In the context of physical systems governed by a variational principle, the relationship between continuous symmetries and conservation laws is established by Noether's Theorem. This result unifies the geometric perspective of Lie groups with the analytic framework of the calculus of variations, demonstrating that every differentiable symmetry of the action integral corresponds to a local conservation law.</p>
<h2>Variational Symmetries and the Action Functional</h2>
<p>We consider a system of differential equations derived from a variational principle. Let $x = (x^1, \dots, x^n)$ denote independent variables and $u = (u^1, \dots, u^m)$ denote dependent variables. The physics of the system is encoded in a Lagrangian function $L(x, u, u^{(k)})$, which depends on $x$, $u$, and derivatives up to order $k$. The action functional $\mathcal{S}[u]$ is defined over a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ as:</p>
$$
\mathcal{S}[u] = \int_{\Omega} L(x, u, u^{(k)}) \, dx.
$$

<p>The condition for $u$ to be a critical point of the action—typically a stationary point where the first variation vanishes—yields the Euler-Lagrange equations:</p>
$$
E_\alpha(L) = \sum_{J} (-D)_J \frac{\partial L}{\partial u^\alpha_J} = 0, \quad \alpha = 1, \dots, m,
$$

<p>where $D_J$ represents the total derivative operator corresponding to the multi-index $J$.</p>
<p>A vector field $\mathbf{v} = \xi^i(x,u)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \phi^\alpha(x,u)\frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$ generates a variational symmetry group if its action leaves the integral invariant. Rigorously, strict invariance of the integral requires the Lagrangian density to be invariant up to a total divergence. The infinitesimal criterion for a variational symmetry is given by:</p>
$$
\text{pr}^{(k)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L \text{Div}(\xi) = \text{Div}(B),
$$

<p>where $\text{pr}^{(k)}\mathbf{v}$ is the $k$-th prolongation of the vector field acting on the derivatives in $L$, $\text{Div}(\xi) = D_i \xi^i$ is the total divergence of the independent variable coefficients, and $B = (B^1, \dots, B^n)$ is a vector tuple allowing for divergence symmetries (Bessel-Hagen symmetries).</p>
<h2>Noether's First Theorem</h2>
<p>The fundamental connection between these symmetries and conservation laws arises from a key identity in the calculus of variations. For any vector field $\mathbf{v}$, the variation of the Lagrangian can be decomposed into a term proportional to the Euler-Lagrange equations and a total divergence term. Let $Q^\alpha = \phi^\alpha - \xi^i u^\alpha_i$ be the characteristic of the vector field $\mathbf{v}$. The fundamental identity states:</p>
$$
\text{pr}^{(k)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L \text{Div}(\xi) = \sum_{\alpha} Q^\alpha E_\alpha(L) + \text{Div}(A),
$$

<p>where $A$ is a specific vector function depending on the Lagrangian and the vector field components. By equating the symmetry condition to this identity, we find that on the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations (where $E_\alpha(L) = 0$), the divergence of the difference $(A - B)$ vanishes.</p>
<p>This yields Noether's First Theorem: For every one-parameter group of variational symmetries generated by $\mathbf{v}$, there exists a current $P = (P^1, \dots, P^n)$ defined by $P = A - B$ such that:</p>
$$
\text{Div}(P) = D_i P^i = 0
$$

<p>holds for all solutions $u(x)$. The components $P^i$ are the conserved fluxes. In the case of time-translation symmetry ($\mathbf{v} = \partial_t$), the associated conserved quantity corresponds to energy; for spatial translations ($\mathbf{v} = \partial_{x^i}$), it corresponds to momentum. This theorem transforms the search for conservation laws from an ad hoc analytic procedure into a geometric classification problem of the symmetry group of the action.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Harmonic Oscillator</strong></p>
<p>Consider the Lagrangian for a harmonic oscillator: $L(q,\dot{q},t) = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{q}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k q^2$.</p>
<p>The Euler-Lagrange equation is $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0$, which gives $\frac{d}{dt}(m \dot{q}) + k q = 0$, or $m \ddot{q} + k q = 0$.</p>
<p>The time-translation symmetry has generator $\mathbf{v} = \partial_t$ with $\xi = 1$ and $\phi = 0$ (no change in $q$). The characteristic is $Q = \phi - \xi \dot{q} = - \dot{q}$.</p>
<p>To verify this is a variational symmetry, we compute the prolongation: $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) = 0$ since $L$ is independent of $t$. The divergence is $\text{Div}(\xi) = \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t} = 0$. The symmetry condition $0 + L \cdot 0 = \text{Div}(B)$ implies $B = 0$.</p>
<p>Using the Noether identity $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L \text{Div}(\xi) = Q E(L) + \text{Div}(A)$, and noting that $E(L) = 0$ on solutions, we find $\text{Div}(P) = 0$ where $P = A - B$. The explicit current is:</p>
$$
P = \dot{q} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - L = \dot{q}(m \dot{q}) - \left(\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}^2 - \frac{1}{2}kq^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{q}^2 + \frac{1}{2} k q^2 = E
$$

<p>This is the total energy. Verification: $\frac{dE}{dt} = m \dot{q} \ddot{q} + k q \dot{q} = \dot{q} (m \ddot{q} + k q) = 0$ on solutions.</p>
<p>The harmonic oscillator demonstrates the fundamental connection between time-translation symmetry and energy conservation. This is not a coincidence but a universal principle: whenever the Lagrangian is independent of time, the system possesses time-translation symmetry, and Noether's theorem guarantees energy conservation.</p>
<p><strong>Kepler Problem and Angular Momentum</strong></p>
<p>Consider central force motion with Lagrangian in polar coordinates: $L(r, \dot{r}, \dot{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} m (\dot{r}^2 + r^2 \dot{\theta}^2) - V(r)$.</p>
<p>The Euler-Lagrange equations are $\frac{d}{dt}(m \dot{r}) - m r \dot{\theta}^2 + V'(r) = 0$ and $\frac{d}{dt}(m r^2 \dot{\theta}) = 0$.</p>
<p>The rotational symmetry has generator $\mathbf{v} = \partial_\theta$ with $\xi^r = 0$, $\xi^\theta = 1$, $\phi^r = 0$, and $\phi^\theta = 0$. The characteristics are $Q^r = 0$ and $Q^\theta = -\dot{\theta}$.</p>
<p>The Noether current is $P^r = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = m r^2 \dot{\theta} = \ell$, which is the angular momentum.</p>
<p>The complete conservation laws are: time translation $\partial_t$ gives energy $E = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2) + V(r)$, and rotation $\partial_\theta$ gives angular momentum $\ell = m r^2 \dot{\theta}$.</p>
<p>From $\ell = \text{constant}$, we have $\dot{\theta} = \frac{\ell}{m r^2}$. Substituting into the energy gives $E = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{r}^2 + \frac{\ell^2}{2 m r^2} + V(r)$, reducing the 2D problem to 1D effective potential motion.</p>
<p>Rotational symmetry in the Kepler problem leads directly to angular momentum conservation, which enables the reduction from two-dimensional motion to one-dimensional radial motion. This reduction is the foundation of the classical solution of planetary orbits.</p>
<h2>Coordinate Reduction and Canonical Forms</h2>
<p>Beyond generating conservation laws, symmetries allow for the reduction of the variational problem itself. If a variational problem admits a symmetry group $G$, it is often possible to express the Lagrangian in terms of the invariants of the group. By introducing canonical coordinates $y = (r, s)$ such that the vector field becomes a simple translation $\mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial s}$, the Lagrangian can be rewritten in a form independent of the coordinate $s$.</p>
<p>This leads to the principle of symmetric criticality, which states that under certain topological conditions on the group action (specifically regarding compactness or properness), critical points of the symmetry-reduced action functional correspond to symmetric critical points of the original action. This allows one to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations on the quotient space $\Omega / G$, effectively reducing the dimension of the partial differential equation.</p>
<p><strong>Spherically Symmetric Laplace Equation</strong></p>
<p>Solve $\Delta u = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with radial symmetry.</p>
<p>The original problem is $\Delta u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \Delta_{S^2} u = 0$. The $SO(3)$ rotation group acts on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with invariants $r = \vert \mathbf{x} \vert$.</p>
<p>Let $u(r, \theta, \phi) = v(r)$, so the symmetry-reduced function depends only on $r$. The original variational problem is $\mathcal{S}[u] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \vert \nabla u \vert^2 dV$. In spherical coordinates with $u = v(r)$:</p>
$$
\mathcal{S}[v] = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} v'^2 r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi d\theta dr = 4\pi \int_0^\infty (v')^2 r^2 dr
$$

<p>The Lagrangian density is $L(r, v, v') = (v')^2 r^2$. The reduced Euler-Lagrange equation is:</p>
$$
\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v'}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = 0
$$

<p>which gives $\frac{d}{dr}(2 r^2 v') = 0$, so $r^2 v' = C$. Integrating yields $v(r) = C \int \frac{dr}{r^2} = -\frac{C}{r} + D$.</p>
<p>Verification: $\Delta\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = 0$ for $r > 0$.</p>
<p>Symmetry reduction transforms the three-dimensional Laplace equation into a one-dimensional ODE. The radial solution $v(r) = C/r + D$ emerges naturally from the reduced variational problem, demonstrating how symmetry simplifies the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Wave Equation Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Reduce $u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}$ with $x$-translation symmetry.</p>
<p>The symmetry generator is $\mathbf{v} = \partial_x$ with characteristic $Q = -u_x$. Solving the characteristic equation $\frac{dx}{1} = \frac{du}{0}$ gives invariants $s = x - t$ and $r = u$.</p>
<p>With coordinate transformation $u(x,t) = v(s)$ where $s = x - t$, we have $u_t = -v_s$, $u_{tt} = v_{ss}$, $u_x = v_s$, and $u_{xx} = v_{ss}$. The transformed equation is $v_{ss} = c^2 v_{ss}$, or $(1 - c^2) v_{ss} = 0$.</p>
<p>For $c \neq 1$: $v_{ss} = 0$ implies $v(s) = A + B s$, so $u(x,t) = A + B(x - t)$. For $c = 1$, the equation is trivial and all functions $v(s)$ work.</p>
<p>Translation symmetry reduces the wave equation to an ODE in the characteristic variable $s = x - t$. This reduction reveals the fundamental structure of wave propagation: solutions depend only on the combination $x - ct$.</p>
<h2>Infinite Symmetries and Hamiltonian Structures</h2>
<p>While Noether's theorem typically associates finite-dimensional Lie groups with finite sets of conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum), certain systems possess infinite-dimensional symmetry groups. This phenomenon is a hallmark of completely integrable systems, such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation:</p>
$$
u_t + 6uu_x + u_{xxx} = 0.
$$

<p>The KdV equation can be formulated as a Hamiltonian system $u_t = \mathcal{D} \frac{\delta H}{\delta u}$, where $\mathcal{D} = \partial_x$ is a Hamiltonian operator and $H$ is a functional. The existence of recursion operators allows for the generation of an infinite hierarchy of symmetries. By an extension of Noether's theorem to generalized symmetries (where $\xi$ and $\phi$ depend on derivatives of $u$), each of these infinite symmetries corresponds to a conservation law. Thus, the integrability of the system—its ability to support soliton solutions that interact elastically—is algebraically encoded in the infinite sequence of conservation laws generated by its symmetry structure.</p>
<p><strong>KdV Infinite Conservation Laws</strong></p>
<p>Demonstrate the first three conservation laws of the KdV equation $u_t + 6 u u_x + u_{xxx} = 0$ with Hamiltonian structure $u_t = \partial_x \frac{\delta H_n}{\delta u}$.</p>
<p>The first three Hamiltonians are: $H_0 = \int u \, dx$ (mass), $H_1 = \int \frac{1}{2} u^2 \, dx$ (momentum), and $H_2 = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} u_x^2 - u^3 \right) \, dx$ (energy).</p>
<p>The recursion operator $R = \partial_x^2 + 4u + 2 u_x \partial_x^{-1}$ generates the symmetries: $Q_0 = u$ (translation), $Q_1 = u_x$ (Galilean boost), and $Q_2 = u_{xx} - 6 u u_x$ (scaling).</p>
<p>For each $Q_n$, the conserved current is $P_n = Q_n \frac{\delta H_2}{\delta u} - H_n$. For $n=1$, we have $\frac{\delta H_2}{\delta u} = -u_{xx} - 3 u^2$, so $P_1 = u_x (-u_{xx} - 3 u^2) - \frac{1}{2} u^2$. On solutions, $D_x P_1 = 0$.</p>
<p>The hierarchy pattern continues: $n=0$ gives mass, $n=1$ gives momentum, $n=2$ gives energy, and $n=3$ gives higher moments. Each symmetry in the infinite hierarchy corresponds to a conservation law, encoding the complete integrability of the system.</p>
<p>The infinite hierarchy of conservation laws for the KdV equation demonstrates that integrability is not a property of isolated equations but a feature of the algebraic structure. Each conservation law restricts the phase space, preventing the thermalization of energy and allowing soliton solutions to persist.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Coefficient Lagrangian</strong></p>
<p>Consider a Lagrangian with explicit time dependence: $L(t, q, \dot{q}) = \frac{1}{2} m(t) \dot{q}^2 - V(q, t)$.</p>
<p>For the symmetry analysis, consider $\mathbf{v} = \tau(t) \partial_t + \eta(t, q) \partial_q$. The variational symmetry condition is:</p>
$$
\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L (D_t \tau) = D_t B
$$

<p>Explicit calculation gives $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) = m(t) \dot{q} \ddot{\eta} + \dot{\eta} \dot{m}(t) \dot{q} - \eta \frac{\partial V}{\partial q} + \tau \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$.</p>
<p>For the specific case with linear time dependence $m(t) = m_0 (1 + \alpha t)$ and $V(q,t) = \frac{1}{2} k q^2$, the symmetry $\mathbf{v} = \partial_t$ works if $\alpha = 0$. A new symmetry is $\mathbf{v} = t \partial_t + \frac{1}{2} q \partial_q$ (scaling).</p>
<p>The Noether current for the scaling symmetry is $P = Q \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - t L$ where $Q = \frac{1}{2} q - t \dot{q}$. This gives a conserved "virial" quantity, demonstrating how time-dependent systems can still possess nontrivial symmetries.</p>
<p>Time-dependent systems require careful analysis of variational symmetries. The scaling symmetry in this example provides a conserved quantity that generalizes the virial theorem to time-dependent mass systems.</p>
<h2>Challenge Problems</h2>
<p>The following problems synthesize the concepts of variational symmetries, Noether's theorem, and symmetry reduction.</p>
<h3>Challenge 1: Bessel-Hagen Symmetries</h3>
<p>A Lagrangian $L = \frac{1}{2} (\nabla u)^2 + f(t) u$ with standard Noether analysis gives only $\int u_t$ conservation. However, by considering divergence symmetries (Bessel-Hagen symmetries) where the symmetry condition is $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L = D_t B$ with $B \neq 0$, show that there exists a more general conservation law.</p>
<p>Derive the Bessel-Hagen extension for $\mathbf{v} = \partial_t$ and identify the true conserved quantity.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: The symmetry condition allows the Lagrangian to change by a total divergence, not just remain invariant. Compute $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L)$ and solve for $B$.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

For $\mathbf{v} = \partial_t$, we have $\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) = u_t u_{tt} + f'(t) u$. The Bessel-Hagen symmetry condition requires:

$$
\text{pr}^{(1)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L = D_t B
$$

Solving for $B$, we find $B = u u_t + F(t)$ where $F(t)$ is an antiderivative of $f(t)$.

The conserved current is $P = A - B$. However, direct computation shows $P = u u_t + F(t) - u u_t - F(t) = 0$ on solutions, which seems trivial.

The true conservation law is more subtle. The conserved quantity is actually:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int \left( \frac{1}{2} u_t^2 - \frac{1}{2} \vert \nabla u \vert^2 - f(t) u \right) dx = 0
$$

This demonstrates that Bessel-Hagen symmetries can reveal conservation laws that are not immediately apparent from the standard Noether procedure. The divergence term $B$ encodes additional structure that becomes visible only when considering the full symmetry group of the system.

</details>

<h3>Challenge 2: Symmetry Reduction of Variational Problems</h3>
<p>Show that if a variational problem $\mathcal{S}[u] = \int L(x, u, u^{(k)}) dx$ admits a symmetry group $G$ with generator $\mathbf{v}$, then the reduced problem on the quotient space $\Omega / G$ preserves the variational structure. Specifically, if canonical coordinates $(r, s)$ are chosen such that $\mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial s}$, then the reduced Lagrangian $\tilde{L}(r, v, v^{(k)})$ obtained by eliminating $s$ yields Euler-Lagrange equations that are equivalent to the symmetry-reduced equations of the original system.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: Use the principle of symmetric criticality and show that critical points of the reduced action correspond to symmetric critical points of the original action.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

The principle of symmetric criticality states that under certain topological conditions (compactness or properness of the group action), critical points of the symmetry-reduced action functional correspond to symmetric critical points of the original action.

In canonical coordinates $(r, s)$ where $\mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial s}$, the Lagrangian becomes independent of $s$: $L(x, u, u^{(k)}) = \tilde{L}(r, v, v^{(k)})$ where $v$ represents the invariants.

The reduced action is $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}[v] = \int \tilde{L}(r, v, v^{(k)}) dr$. The Euler-Lagrange equations for this reduced action are:

$$
\sum_{J} (-D_r)_J \frac{\partial \tilde{L}}{\partial v_J} = 0
$$

These equations are equivalent to the symmetry-reduced equations of the original system. The key insight is that the symmetry constraint $u = u(r)$ (independent of $s$) is automatically satisfied by solutions of the reduced Euler-Lagrange equations.

This demonstrates that symmetry reduction preserves the variational structure: the reduced system is still a variational problem, and its solutions correspond to symmetric solutions of the original system. This is the foundation of the method of symmetric criticality, which allows us to solve high-dimensional problems by reducing to lower-dimensional variational problems.

</details>

<h3>Challenge 3: Generalized Symmetries and Conservation Laws</h3>
<p>Extend Noether's theorem to generalized symmetries where the infinitesimals $\xi$ and $\phi$ depend on derivatives of $u$: $\xi = \xi(x, u, u^{(1)}, \dots, u^{(k)})$ and $\phi = \phi(x, u, u^{(1)}, \dots, u^{(k)})$. Show that the characteristic $Q = \phi - \xi^i u_i$ still generates a conservation law through the same mechanism, and apply this to show that the infinite hierarchy of symmetries of the KdV equation corresponds to an infinite sequence of conservation laws.</p>
<p><em>(Hint: The prolongation formula extends naturally to generalized symmetries. The key is that the characteristic $Q$ still satisfies the same identity relating symmetries to conservation laws.)</em></p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Solution</strong></summary>

For generalized symmetries, the prolongation formula extends naturally. The characteristic is still defined as $Q^\alpha = \phi^\alpha - \xi^i u^\alpha_i$, but now $\xi$ and $\phi$ depend on derivatives.

The fundamental identity still holds:

$$
\text{pr}^{(k)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L \text{Div}(\xi) = \sum_{\alpha} Q^\alpha E_\alpha(L) + \text{Div}(A)
$$

where $A$ now depends on the derivatives through $\xi$ and $\phi$. The symmetry condition is still $\text{pr}^{(k)}\mathbf{v}(L) + L \text{Div}(\xi) = \text{Div}(B)$.

On solutions where $E_\alpha(L) = 0$, we have $\text{Div}(A - B) = 0$, so $P = A - B$ is a conserved current.

For the KdV equation, the recursion operator $R = \partial_x^2 + 4u + 2u_x \partial_x^{-1}$ generates an infinite hierarchy of symmetries $Q_n = R^n Q_0$ where $Q_0 = u$. Each $Q_n$ is a generalized symmetry (depending on derivatives of $u$), and by the extended Noether theorem, each corresponds to a conservation law.

The Hamiltonians $H_n$ are the conserved quantities, and the infinite sequence $\{H_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ encodes the complete integrability of the system. This demonstrates that integrability is fundamentally a property of the symmetry structure: systems with infinite-dimensional symmetry groups possess infinite sequences of conservation laws, preventing energy thermalization and allowing soliton solutions.

</details>

<p>Noether's theorem provides a systematic method for finding conservation laws from symmetries, but it requires the system to be derivable from a variational principle. Many physically important systems, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, are not variational, limiting the direct application of Noether's theorem. The extension to nonlocal symmetries through potential systems, developed in Section 4.8, overcomes this limitation by constructing variational formulations for non-variational systems.</p>
