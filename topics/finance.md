# Finance: Mathematics in Action

Modern finance is applied stochastic control, optimization, and numerical methods — all born from defense problems.

## Core Ideas

### Black-Scholes (1973)

- **Root**: Itô calculus (stochastic differential equations)
- **Origin**: Same math as control theory (Pontryagin, Bellman)
- **Application**: Option pricing, risk-neutral valuation

$$dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW$$

### High-Frequency Trading

- **Root**: Real-time signal processing (Kalman filters)
- **Origin**: Radar, missile tracking
- **Application**: Market making, latency arbitrage
