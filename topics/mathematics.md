# Mathematics: Solving Defense Problems

Modern applied mathematics emerged from the need to solve large-scale logistical, optimization, and control problems during and after WWII.

## Key Developments

### 1. Linear Programming (1947–1953)

- **Origin**: Project SCOOP (U.S. Air Force), George Dantzig
- **Impact**: Fundamental optimization tool for logistics, resource allocation
- **Application**: Operations research, finance, machine learning

> **Engineering Principle**: Formulate constraints → optimize objective → deploy solution.

### 2. Control Theory and Dynamic Programming (1950s–1960s)

- **Origin**: RAND Corporation, Bellman (Dynamic Programming), Pontryagin (Optimal Control)
- **Impact**: Missile guidance, robotics, economics
- **Application**: Reinforcement learning, optimal control systems

### 3. Numerical Analysis and Matrix Methods

- **Origin**: ENIAC, von Neumann, Householder
- **Impact**: Computational linear algebra, eigenvalue problems
- **Application**: Scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning
