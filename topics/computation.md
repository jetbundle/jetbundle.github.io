# Computation: Deliberate Construction

Interactive computing, networking, and time-sharing were not inevitable — they were deliberate military-academic projects.

## Key Developments

### 1. ENIAC and Early Scientific Computing (1943–1946)

- **Origin**: U.S. Army Ordnance, University of Pennsylvania
- **Impact**: First programmable electronic computer
- **Application**: Weather prediction, nuclear simulations, trajectory calculations

---

### 2. Time-Sharing and Interactive Computing (1960s)

- **Origin**: ARPA IPTO, Project MAC (MIT), J.C.R. Licklider
- **Impact**: Modern interactive computing paradigm
- **Application**: Operating systems, cloud computing, development environments

> **Engineering Principle**: Shared resources → interactive access → networked systems.

### 3. Packet-Switching and ARPANET (1960s–1970s)

- **Origin**: ARPA, RAND Corporation (Paul Baran), NPL (Donald Davies)
- **Impact**: Foundation of the internet
- **Application**: Distributed systems, cloud infrastructure
