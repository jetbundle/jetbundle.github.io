# Section 4.8: Nonlocal Symmetries & Potential Systems

## Introduction

We push beyond point symmetries. By introducing **Potential Variables** via conservation laws, we discover **Nonlocal Symmetries** hidden from the Lie algorithm. This reveals that the "algebraic structure" of a PDE depends on the choice of covering space.
