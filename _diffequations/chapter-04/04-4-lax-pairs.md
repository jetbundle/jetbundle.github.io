# Section 4.4: Lax Pairs & Zero-Curvature Representations

## Introduction

We present the central algebraic mechanism of integrability. We rewrite nonlinear evolution as an **Isospectral Flow** of a linear operator (the **Lax Pair**). The PDE becomes the condition that the eigenvalues of this operator are constant. Geometrically, this is formulated as a **Zero-Curvature Condition** for a connection on a fiber bundle.
