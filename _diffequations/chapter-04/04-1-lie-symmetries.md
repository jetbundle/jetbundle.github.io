# Section 4.1: Lie Symmetries & Prolongation

## Introduction

We systematize the "tricks" of Chapter 1. We view symmetries as continuous groups acting on the solution space. We introduce **Prolongation** to lift vector fields to the jet space of derivatives. The **Determining Equations** provide an algorithmic method to find all symmetries of a given PDE, allowing for systematic **Symmetry Reduction**.
