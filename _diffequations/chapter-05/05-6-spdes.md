# Section 5.6: SPDEs & Regularity Structures

## Introduction

We tackle the problem of multiplying distributions (e.g., noise $\times$ solution). We present Hairer's **Regularity Structures** as a generalization of Taylor expansions to "noisy" bases. We revisit **Renormalization** (from Ch 1.7) as a rigorous algebraic requirement to define these equations, subtracting infinite counterterms to yield finite physics.
