# Section 5.4: Rough Paths & Controlled Rough Paths

## Introduction

We decouple roughness from probability. We introduce the **Signature** of a path and Terry Lyons' **Rough Path Theory**. We show that to solve differential equations driven by rough signals, one must track not just the path, but its iterated integrals. This is a deterministic theory of non-smooth calculus.
