# Section 5.7: Kinetic Theory & Mean-Field Games

## Introduction

We connect the microscopic to the macroscopic. We derive the **Boltzmann Equation** from particle dynamics and study **Mean-Field Games** as the limit of $N \to \infty$ agents. We introduce **Wasserstein Gradient Flows** to view diffusion as geometry on the space of probability measures.
