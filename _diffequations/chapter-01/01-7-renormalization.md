# Section 1.7: Classical Renormalization & Non-Perturbative Methods

## Introduction

The chapter concludes with a crisis: perturbation series often diverge factorially ($\sum n! x^n$). We introduce **Renormalization Group (RG)** techniques for ODEs to resum secular terms and **Borel Summation** to assign meaning to divergent series. We touch upon **Non-perturbative effects** (Instantons) that are invisible to power series.
