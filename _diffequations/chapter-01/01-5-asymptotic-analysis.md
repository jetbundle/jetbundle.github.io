# Section 1.5: Asymptotic Analysis

## Introduction

Acknowledging that exact solutions are rare, we turn to approximation in limits. **Laplace's Method** and **Stationary Phase** reveal that integrals are dominated by critical points. The **WKB Approximation** connects wave mechanics to classical ray trajectories. This module emphasizes "local truth"—accurate behavior at $\infty$ or $0$—while exposing the lack of global connection formulas, necessitating a topological understanding of the Stokes phenomenon.
