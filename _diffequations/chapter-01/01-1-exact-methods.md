# Section 1.1: Exact Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations

## Introduction

We begin with the concept of reduction to quadrature. We examine **Separable** and **Exact** equations not as algebraic tricks, but as manifestations of local geometry—specifically, the search for a coordinate system where the vector field flattens. We introduce the **Riccati Equation** to show how nonlinear problems can sometimes be linearized via transformation. The section concludes with the failure of these methods for non-integrable systems, introducing the concept of **Chaos** as the generic state of dynamical systems.
