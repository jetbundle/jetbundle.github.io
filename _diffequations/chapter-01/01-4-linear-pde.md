# Section 1.4: Classical Linear Partial Differential Equations

## Introduction

We extend ODE methods to fields. **Separation of Variables** is framed as the simultaneous diagonalization of commuting operators. We demonstrate that the geometry of the domain (sphere, cylinder, box) dictates the choice of special functions. **Eigenfunction Expansions** are constructed, but we highlight the open question: in what metric space does an infinite series of functions converge to a discontinuous boundary condition?
