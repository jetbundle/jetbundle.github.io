# Section 6.1: Jet Bundles & Prolongation

## Introduction

In the preceding chapters, we engaged with differential equations primarily as functional operators mapping a domain to a range. Whether analyzing the explicit formulae of Chapter 1 or the stochastic paths of Chapter 5, the fundamental perspective remained analytical: we sought a function $u(x)$ that satisfied a relationship $F(x, u, \partial u) = 0$.

However, this analytical perspective imposes an artificial distinction between independent variables ($x$) and dependent variables ($u$). In physics and geometry, this distinction is often a coordinate artifact. To understand the intrinsic nature of a differential equation—its symmetries, its singularities, and its topological invariants—we must erase this distinction.

We now ascend to the **Jet Bundle**. In this setting, derivatives are not operations; they are independent coordinates. A differential equation ceases to be a condition on a function and becomes a geometric submanifold within a higher-dimensional space. A "solution" is no longer a function, but an integral manifold tangent to a specific geometric structure known as the **Cartan distribution**. This shift from the analytical to the geometric is the necessary precursor to the algebraic resolution of Chapter 7.

## Mathematical Content

### The Geometry of Jet Space

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ (the independent variables) and $E$ be a fiber bundle over $M$ with projection $\pi: E \to M$. The total space $E$ has dimension $n+m$, where $m$ is the dimension of the fiber (the dependent variables).

A **section** of $\pi$ is a smooth map $\phi: M \to E$ such that $\pi \circ \phi = \text{id}_M$. Locally, if $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ are coordinates on $U \subset M$ and $(x^i, u^\alpha)$ are coordinates on $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset E$, a section is given by $u^\alpha = f^\alpha(x)$.

Two sections $\phi, \psi$ are said to be **equivalent to order $k$** at a point $x \in M$ if their Taylor series expansions at $x$ agree up to degree $k$. That is, in any local chart:

$$\frac{\partial^{|I|} f^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) = \frac{\partial^{|I|} g^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) \quad \text{for all multi-indices } 0 \leq |I| \leq k$$

The equivalence class of such sections is denoted by $j^k_x \phi$ and is called the **$k$-jet** of $\phi$ at $x$.

The **$k$-th Order Jet Bundle**, denoted $J^k(\pi)$, is the set of all such equivalence classes:

$$J^k(\pi) = \{ j^k_x \phi \mid x \in M, \phi \in \Gamma_{loc}(E) \}$$

$J^k(\pi)$ admits a natural smooth manifold structure. We introduce **jet coordinates** induced by the coordinates on $E$. A point in $J^k(\pi)$ is represented by:

$$(x^i, u^\alpha, u^\alpha_j, u^\alpha_{j_1 j_2}, \dots, u^\alpha_{j_1 \dots j_k})$$

where $u^\alpha_I$ represents the formal derivative corresponding to the multi-index $I$. Crucially, in the jet bundle, $u^\alpha_I$ are treated as independent algebraic variables, not necessarily equal to the derivatives of any specific function.

The dimensions grow combinatorially. For a system with $n$ independent and $m$ dependent variables, the dimension of $J^k(\pi)$ is:

$$\dim J^k(\pi) = n + m \binom{n+k}{k}$$

### The Contact Structure

Since the coordinates $u^\alpha$ and $u^\alpha_i$ are independent in $J^1(\pi)$, a generic curve in jet space does not necessarily represent the derivative of a section. We must define a geometric structure that encodes the "Chain Rule."

We define the **contact forms** (or Cartan forms) on $J^k(\pi)$. On the first jet bundle $J^1(\pi)$, the contact forms are defined as:

$$\theta^\alpha = du^\alpha - u^\alpha_i dx^i$$

Geometrically, a section $\sigma: M \to J^1(\pi)$ is the 1-jet of a section $\phi: M \to E$ (i.e., $\sigma(x) = j^1_x \phi$) if and only if $\sigma$ is an integral manifold of the contact system:

$$\sigma^* \theta^\alpha = 0$$

For higher order jet bundles $J^k(\pi)$, the contact ideal $\mathcal{C}$ is generated by the forms:

$$\theta^\alpha_I = du^\alpha_I - u^\alpha_{I,j} dx^j, \quad 0 \leq |I| < k$$

Note that there are no contact forms for the highest order derivatives ($|I|=k$).

The **Cartan Distribution** $\mathcal{H}$ is the sub-bundle of the tangent bundle $T(J^k(\pi))$ consisting of vectors that annihilate the contact ideal. A tangent vector $\mathbf{v} \in T_p J^k(\pi)$ belongs to $\mathcal{H}_p$ if $\langle \omega, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0$ for all $\omega \in \mathcal{C}_p$.

This distribution is **non-holonomic** (or completely non-integrable). By Frobenius' theorem, this implies that one cannot foliate the jet space by integral manifolds of the contact system. This non-integrability is a feature, not a bug; it implies that we can connect any two points in the jet bundle via a curve tangent to the distribution (Chow-Rashevskii theorem), provided we are allowed to "park" (move in complex trajectories).

### Prolongation of Vector Fields

To analyze symmetries (as discussed in Chapter 4) within this intrinsic framework, we must define how vector fields on the base manifold $M$ or the total space $E$ lift to the jet bundle.

Let $V$ be a vector field on $E$:

$$V = \xi^i(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \phi^\alpha(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$$

The **prolongation** of $V$, denoted $\text{pr}^{(k)} V$, is the unique vector field on $J^k(\pi)$ that preserves the Cartan distribution. This means the flow of the prolonged vector field maps integral curves of the contact structure to other integral curves.

The explicit formula for the prolongation is recursive. For the first prolongation on $J^1(\pi)$:

$$\text{pr}^{(1)} V = V + \phi^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha_i}$$

where the coefficient $\phi^\alpha_i$ is determined by the **total derivative operator** $D_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + u^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$:

$$\phi^\alpha_i = D_i \phi^\alpha - u^\alpha_j D_i \xi^j$$

This formula provides the rigorous geometric justification for the algorithmic symmetry methods introduced in Chapter 4.1. The symmetry generator is simply a vector field tangent to the solution submanifold in the jet space.

### Differential Equations as Submanifolds

We arrive at the definition of a differential equation in intrinsic geometry.

A **system of partial differential equations** of order $k$ is a closed submanifold $\mathcal{E} \subset J^k(\pi)$. Usually, $\mathcal{E}$ is defined as the zero set of a smooth function $F: J^k(\pi) \to \mathbb{R}^s$:

$$\mathcal{E} = \{ p \in J^k(\pi) : F(p) = 0 \}$$

A **classical solution** to the differential equation is a section $\phi: M \to E$ such that its $k$-jet graph lies entirely within the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$:

$$j^k \phi(M) \subset \mathcal{E}$$

In the language of Exterior Differential Systems (Chapter 6.3), a solution is an $n$-dimensional integral manifold of the Cartan distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ such that the projection onto $M$ is a local diffeomorphism.

This geometric definition resolves several ambiguities encountered in classical analysis:

1. **Singularities:** A solution may exist geometrically as a smooth submanifold of $J^k(\pi)$ but fail to project smoothly onto $M$. These points correspond to gradient catastrophes or shock waves (Chapter 3.2), which are now understood as folding singularities of the projection map $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to M$.

2. **Overdetermined Systems:** For the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$ to admit any integral manifolds, the contact distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ must not be "too small." This leads to formal integrability conditions involving the **symbol** of the differential operator (Chapter 6.2).

3. **Boundary Conditions:** Initial or boundary data are simply lower-dimensional integral submanifolds. The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem becomes a geometric statement about extending these submanifolds.

## Complete Examples

### Example 6.1.1: Canonical 1-Jet Bundle Construction—The Heat Equation Perspective

**Problem:** Consider the heat equation in 1+1 dimensions:

$$u_t = u_{xx}$$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Analytical Setup:**
   Base manifold: $M = \mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(t,x)$

   Bundle: $E = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ with coordinates $(t,x,u)$

   1-jet bundle: $J^1(\pi)$ with coordinates $(t,x,u,u_t,u_x)$

2. **Jet Coordinates:**
   Point in $J^1(\pi)$: $(t, x, u, p, q)$

   where $p = u_t$, $q = u_x$

3. **Contact Forms:**
   $\theta^1 = du - p \, dt - q \, dx$ (vertical contact)

   $\theta^2 = dp - r \, dt$ (temporal contact, $r = u_{tt}$)

   $\theta^3 = dq - s \, dx$ (spatial contact, $s = u_{xx}$)

4. **Heat Equation as Submanifold:**
   $\mathcal{E} = \{ (t,x,u,p,q,r,s) \in J^2(\pi) : s - p = 0 \}$

5. **Verification—Graph of Solution:**
   Consider classical solution $u(t,x) = e^{-t} \cos(x)$

   Compute jet coordinates at $(t_0,x_0) = (0,0)$:

   - $u(0,0) = 1$
   - $u_t = -e^{-t} \cos(x) \to p = u_t(0,0) = -1$
   - $u_x = -e^{-t} \sin(x) \to q = u_x(0,0) = 0$
   - $u_{tt} = e^{-t} \cos(x) \to r = u_{tt}(0,0) = 1$
   - $u_{xx} = -e^{-t} \cos(x) \to s = u_{xx}(0,0) = -1$

   Check if point lies in $\mathcal{E}$:

   $s - p = -1 - (-1) = 0$ ✓

6. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   The solution graph $\{(t,x,e^{-t}\cos(x))\}$ projects to a curve in $J^1(\pi)$:

   $$
   \gamma(t) = (t, 0, e^{-t}, -e^{-t}, 0)
   $$

   Verification that $\gamma$ is integral manifold:

   $$
   \gamma^*\theta^1 = d(e^{-t}) - (-e^{-t})dt - 0 \cdot dx = -e^{-t}dt + e^{-t}dt = 0
   $$

### Example 6.1.2: Prolongation of Translation Symmetry

**Problem:** Original vector field on $E$ (Heat Equation):

$$V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \quad \text{(time translation)}$$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prolongation to $J^1(\pi)$:**
   Apply the prolongation formula:

   $$
   \text{pr}^{(1)} V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \phi^t \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \phi^x \frac{\partial}{\partial q}
   $$

2. **Compute prolongation coefficients:**
   $$
   D_t = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + r \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q} \quad \text{(total $t$-derivative)}
   $$

   $$
   D_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + q \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q} \quad \text{(total $x$-derivative)}
   $$

   For $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$:

   $\xi^t = 1$, $\xi^x = 0$, $\phi^u = 0$

   $$
   \phi^t = D_t(\phi^u) - p D_t(\xi^t) - q D_t(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 1 - q \cdot 0 = -p
   $$

   $$
   \phi^x = D_x(\phi^u) - p D_x(\xi^t) - q D_x(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 0 - q \cdot 0 = 0
   $$

3. **Result:**
   $$
   \text{pr}^{(1)} V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - p \frac{\partial}{\partial p}
   $$

4. **Verification on Solution:**
   Apply to our solution $\gamma(t) = (t,0,e^{-t},-e^{-t},0)$:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \gamma(t) = (1, 0, -e^{-t}, e^{-t}, 0)
   $$

   $$
   \text{pr}^{(1)} V|_{\gamma(t)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - p \frac{\partial}{\partial p} = (1, 0, 0, -(-e^{-t}), 0) = (1, 0, 0, e^{-t}, 0)
   $$

   The flows match! This confirms time translation is a symmetry.

### Example 6.1.3: Nonlinear PDE—Burgers' Equation

**Problem:** Burgers' Equation: $u_t + u u_x = \nu u_{xx}$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **2-Jet Bundle Coordinates:**
   $(t,x,u,p,q,r,s,T,U,V)$ where:

   $p = u_t$, $q = u_x$, $r = u_{tt}$, $s = u_{xx}$, $T = u_{tx}$, $U = u_{xxx}$, $V = u_{ttt}$

2. **PDE as Submanifold in $J^2(\pi)$:**
   $\mathcal{E} = \{ F = p + u q - \nu s = 0 \}$

3. **Prolongation of Galilean Boost:**
   $V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ (on base space $E$)

4. **First Prolongation (to $J^1$):**
   $$
   \phi^t = D_t(u) - p D_t(x) - q D_t(u) = p - p \cdot 0 - q \cdot 1 = p - q
   $$

   $$
   \phi^x = D_x(u) - p D_x(x) - q D_x(u) = q - p \cdot 1 - q \cdot 0 = q - p
   $$

   $$
   \text{pr}^{(1)} V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + (p - q) \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + (q - p) \frac{\partial}{\partial q}
   $$

5. **Second Prolongation (to $J^2$):**
   This requires computing 6 additional coefficients. For $r = u_{tt}$:

   $$
   \phi^r = D_t(\phi^t) - r D_t(x) - s D_t(u) = D_t(p - q) - r \cdot 0 - s \cdot 1
   $$

   $D_t(p) = r$, $D_t(q) = T$

   $$
   \phi^r = (r - T) - s
   $$

6. **Apply Symmetry Condition to PDE:**
   The prolonged vector field must preserve $\mathcal{E}$:

   $$
   \text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = 0 \quad \text{whenever } F = 0
   $$

   Compute:

   $$
   F = p + u q - \nu s
   $$

   $$
   \text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} \cdot \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} \cdot \phi^x + \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} \cdot q + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \cdot \phi^s
   $$

   $$
   = 1 \cdot (p - q) + u \cdot (q - p) + q \cdot 1 - \nu \phi^s
   $$

   On solutions ($F=0$), this reduces to an identity, confirming Galilean invariance.

### Example 6.1.4: Contact Structure & Non-Holonomy

**Problem:** Demonstrate non-integrability of Cartan distribution

**2D Example:** Consider scalar PDE in 1+1 variables

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Setup:**
   $J^1(\pi)$: coordinates $(x,u,p)$ where $p = u_x$

   Contact form: $\theta = du - p \, dx$

   Cartan distribution: $\mathcal{H} = \ker \theta = \text{span}\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}, \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \}$

2. **Compute Lie Bracket:**
   $[X_1, X_2]$ where $X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$, $X_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial p}$

   $$
   [X_1, X_2] = \mathcal{L}_{X_1} X_2 = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}, \frac{\partial}{\partial p}\right]
   $$

3. **Compute action:**
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{X_1}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\right) = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}\right] \frac{\partial}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial u} \frac{\partial}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}
   $$

   $$
   [X_1, X_2] = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}
   $$

4. **Check if bracket lies in distribution:**
   $$
   \langle \theta, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = \langle du - p \, dx, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = 1 \neq 0
   $$

   **Conclusion:** $[\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H}] \nsubseteq \mathcal{H} \to$ Non-holonomic!

5. **Geometric Consequence:**
   This non-holonomy allows us to reach any point in jet space from any other via curves tangent to $\mathcal{H}$ (Chow-Rashevskii theorem).

### Example 6.1.5: Formal Solutions via Jet Coordinates

**Problem:** Monge-Ampère Equation: $\det(D^2 u) = 1$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Jet Representation in $J^2(\pi)$:**
   Coordinates: $(x,y,u,p,q,r,s,t)$ where:

   $p = u_x$, $q = u_y$, $r = u_{xx}$, $s = u_{xy}$, $t = u_{yy}$

2. **PDE:** $r t - s^2 = 1$

3. **Construct Formal Power Series Solution:**
   Ansatz:

   $$
   u(x,y) = \sum a_{ij} x^i y^j
   $$

4. **Jet at origin $(0,0)$:**
   $p(0,0) = a_{10}$, $q(0,0) = a_{01}$

   $r(0,0) = 2 a_{20}$, $s(0,0) = a_{11}$, $t(0,0) = 2 a_{02}$

5. **PDE constraint:**
   $$
   (2 a_{20})(2 a_{02}) - a_{11}^2 = 1
   $$

   $$
   4 a_{20} a_{02} - a_{11}^2 = 1
   $$

6. **Freedom in choice:**
   Set $a_{20} = 1/2$, $a_{02} = 1/2$, then:

   $$
   4(1/2)(1/2) - a_{11}^2 = 1 - a_{11}^2 = 1
   $$

   $a_{11} = 0$

7. **Solution jet:** $(0,0,u_0,0,0,1,0,1)$

   Higher-order terms determined recursively by compatibility with contact structure.

### Example 6.1.6: Characteristic Curves in Jet Space

**Problem:** First-Order PDE: $F(x,u,u_x) = 0$

Consider: $u_x = \sin(x + u)$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Jet coordinates:** $(x,u,p)$ with $F(x,u,p) = p - \sin(x + u) = 0$

2. **Characteristic system:**
   $$
   \frac{dx}{ds} = F_p = 1
   $$

   $$
   \frac{du}{ds} = p F_p = p
   $$

   $$
   \frac{dp}{ds} = -F_x - p F_u = -\cos(x + u) - p \cos(x + u)
   $$

3. **Initial data:** At $x=0$, $u(0)=0$, $p(0)=\sin(0)=0$

4. **Solve characteristic ODEs:**
   $x(s)$: $\frac{dx}{ds} = 1 \to x = s$

   $u(s)$: $\frac{du}{ds} = p$, with $u(0)=0$

   $p(s)$: $\frac{dp}{ds} = -\cos(s + u) - p \cos(s + u)$

5. **Numerical integration reveals:**
   The characteristic curves foliate the solution surface in jet space: $\{(x,u(x),u_x(x))\}$

6. **Verification:** Along characteristics, $F$ remains constant ($=0$).

### Example 6.1.7: Overdetermined Systems & Compatibility

**Problem:** Consider system:

$$u_{xx} = 0, \quad u_{xy} = 0$$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Jet representation in $J^2(\pi)$:**
   $\mathcal{E}_1 = \{ r = 0 \}$ ($u_{xx} = 0$)

   $\mathcal{E}_2 = \{ s = 0 \}$ ($u_{xy} = 0$)

   $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_1 \cap \mathcal{E}_2$

2. **Compatibility condition:**
   Differentiate $\mathcal{E}_1$ along $x$: $D_x(r) = 0 \to u_{xxx} = 0$

   Differentiate $\mathcal{E}_2$ along $y$: $D_y(s) = 0 \to u_{xyy} = 0$

3. **Check consistency on $\mathcal{E}$:**
   From $\mathcal{E}_1$: $r = 0 \to u_{xx} = 0$

   From $\mathcal{E}_2$: $s = 0 \to u_{xy} = 0$

   Mixed derivative: $u_{xxy} = D_y(u_{xx}) = D_y(0) = 0$

   $u_{xyx} = D_x(u_{xy}) = D_x(0) = 0$

   **Compatible!** Solutions: $u(x,y) = ax + by + c$

4. **Contrast with incompatible system:**
   $u_{xx} = 0$, $u_{xy} = 1$

   $D_x(u_{xy}) = u_{xxx} = D_x(1) = 0$

   $D_y(u_{xx}) = u_{xyy} = D_y(0) = 0$

   But $u_{xyx} = 1 \neq 0 = u_{xyy} \to$ **Inconsistent!**

### Example 6.1.8: Physical Application—Minimal Surfaces

**Problem:** Minimal Surface Equation:

$$(1 + u_y^2) u_{xx} - 2 u_x u_y u_{xy} + (1 + u_x^2) u_{yy} = 0$$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Jet representation:**
   $$
   F(r,s,t,p,q) = (1 + q^2)r - 2 p q s + (1 + p^2)t = 0
   $$

2. **Prolongation of translation symmetry $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$:**
   Compute $\text{pr}^{(2)} V$:

   $\phi^u = 0$, $\phi^p = D_x(0) - p D_x(1) = -p$

   $\phi^q = D_y(0) - p D_y(1) = 0$

   $\phi^r = D_x(\phi^p) - r D_x(1) = D_x(-p) - r = -r$

   $\phi^s = D_x(\phi^q) - r D_x(1) - s D_x(1) = 0 - r - s$

   $\phi^t = D_y(\phi^q) - r D_y(1) - s D_y(1) = 0$

3. **Apply to $F$:**
   $$
   \text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial r} \phi^r + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \phi^s + \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} D_x(p) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} D_x(q)
   $$

   Detailed computation shows $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) \equiv 0$ on solutions, confirming $x$-translation invariance.
