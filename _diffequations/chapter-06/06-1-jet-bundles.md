# Section 6.1: Jet Bundles & Prolongation

> Derivatives become coordinates, and differential equations become geometry.

## Introduction

In the preceding chapters, we engaged with differential equations primarily as functional operators mapping a domain to a range. Whether analyzing the explicit formulae of Chapter 1 or the stochastic paths of Chapter 5, the fundamental perspective remained analytical: we sought a function $u(x)$ that satisfied a relationship $F(x, u, \partial u) = 0$.

However, this analytical perspective imposes an artificial distinction between independent variables ($x$) and dependent variables ($u$). In physics and geometry, this distinction is often a coordinate artifact. To understand the intrinsic nature of a differential equation—its symmetries, its singularities, and its topological invariants—we must erase this distinction.

We now ascend to the **Jet Bundle**. In this setting, derivatives are not operations; they are independent coordinates. A differential equation ceases to be a condition on a function and becomes a geometric submanifold within a higher-dimensional space. A "solution" is no longer a function, but an integral manifold tangent to a specific geometric structure known as the **Cartan distribution**. This shift from the analytical to the geometric is the necessary precursor to the algebraic resolution of Chapter 7.



### The Geometry of Jet Space

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ (the independent variables) and $E$ be a fiber bundle over $M$ with projection $\pi: E \to M$. The total space $E$ has dimension $n+m$, where $m$ is the dimension of the fiber (the dependent variables).

A **section** of $\pi$ is a smooth map $\phi: M \to E$ such that $\pi \circ \phi = \text{id}_M$. Locally, if $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ are coordinates on $U \subset M$ and $(x^i, u^\alpha)$ are coordinates on $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset E$, a section is given by $u^\alpha = f^\alpha(x)$.

Two sections $\phi, \psi$ are said to be **equivalent to order $k$** at a point $x \in M$ if their Taylor series expansions at $x$ agree up to degree $k$. That is, in any local chart:

$$\frac{\partial^{\mid I \mid} f^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) = \frac{\partial^{\mid I \mid} g^\alpha}{\partial x^I}(x) \quad \text{for all multi-indices } 0 \leq \mid I \mid \leq k$$

The equivalence class of such sections is denoted by $j^k_x \phi$ and is called the **$k$-jet** of $\phi$ at $x$.

The **$k$-th Order Jet Bundle**, denoted $J^k(\pi)$, is the set of all such equivalence classes:

$$J^k(\pi) = \{ j^k_x \phi \mid x \in M, \phi \in \Gamma_{loc}(E) \}$$

$J^k(\pi)$ admits a natural smooth manifold structure. We introduce **jet coordinates** induced by the coordinates on $E$. A point in $J^k(\pi)$ is represented by:

$$(x^i, u^\alpha, u^\alpha_j, u^\alpha_{j_1 j_2}, \dots, u^\alpha_{j_1 \dots j_k})$$

where $u^\alpha_I$ represents the formal derivative corresponding to the multi-index $I$. Crucially, in the jet bundle, $u^\alpha_I$ are treated as independent algebraic variables, not necessarily equal to the derivatives of any specific function.

The dimensions grow combinatorially. For a system with $n$ independent and $m$ dependent variables, the dimension of $J^k(\pi)$ is:

$$\dim J^k(\pi) = n + m \binom{n+k}{k}$$

### The Contact Structure

Since the coordinates $u^\alpha$ and $u^\alpha_i$ are independent in $J^1(\pi)$, a generic curve in jet space does not necessarily represent the derivative of a section. We must define a geometric structure that encodes the "Chain Rule."

We define the **contact forms** (or Cartan forms) on $J^k(\pi)$. On the first jet bundle $J^1(\pi)$, the contact forms are defined as:

$$\theta^\alpha = du^\alpha - u^\alpha_i dx^i$$

Geometrically, a section $\sigma: M \to J^1(\pi)$ is the 1-jet of a section $\phi: M \to E$ (i.e., $\sigma(x) = j^1_x \phi$) if and only if $\sigma$ is an integral manifold of the contact system:

$$\sigma^* \theta^\alpha = 0$$

For higher order jet bundles $J^k(\pi)$, the contact ideal $\mathcal{C}$ is generated by the forms:

$$\theta^\alpha_I = du^\alpha_I - u^\alpha_{I,j} dx^j, \quad 0 \leq \mid I \mid < k$$

Note that there are no contact forms for the highest order derivatives ($\mid I \mid =k$).

The **Cartan Distribution** $\mathcal{H}$ is the sub-bundle of the tangent bundle $T(J^k(\pi))$ consisting of vectors that annihilate the contact ideal. A tangent vector $\mathbf{v} \in T_p J^k(\pi)$ belongs to $\mathcal{H}_p$ if $\langle \omega, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0$ for all $\omega \in \mathcal{C}_p$.

This distribution is **non-holonomic** (or completely non-integrable). By Frobenius' theorem, this implies that one cannot foliate the jet space by integral manifolds of the contact system. This non-integrability is a feature, not a bug; it implies that we can connect any two points in the jet bundle via a curve tangent to the distribution (Chow-Rashevskii theorem), provided we are allowed to "park" (move in complex trajectories).

### Prolongation of Vector Fields

To analyze symmetries (as discussed in Chapter 4) within this intrinsic framework, we must define how vector fields on the base manifold $M$ or the total space $E$ lift to the jet bundle.

Let $V$ be a vector field on $E$:

$$V = \xi^i(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \phi^\alpha(x,u) \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$$

The **prolongation** of $V$, denoted $\text{pr}^{(k)} V$, is the unique vector field on $J^k(\pi)$ that preserves the Cartan distribution. This means the flow of the prolonged vector field maps integral curves of the contact structure to other integral curves.

The explicit formula for the prolongation is recursive. For the first prolongation on $J^1(\pi)$:

$$\text{pr}^{(1)} V = V + \phi^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha_i}$$

where the coefficient $\phi^\alpha_i$ is determined by the **total derivative operator** $D_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + u^\alpha_i \frac{\partial}{\partial u^\alpha}$:

$$\phi^\alpha_i = D_i \phi^\alpha - u^\alpha_j D_i \xi^j$$

This formula provides the rigorous geometric justification for the algorithmic symmetry methods introduced in Chapter 4.1. The symmetry generator is simply a vector field tangent to the solution submanifold in the jet space.

> **Prolongation of Time Translation**

> For the heat equation, consider the time translation vector field $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ on the base space $E$. To prolong this to $J^1(\pi)$, we apply the prolongation formula $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = V + \phi^t \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \phi^x \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$.

> The total derivative operators are $D_t = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + r \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$ and $D_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + q \frac{\partial}{\partial u} + s \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$. For $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$, we have $\xi^t = 1$, $\xi^x = 0$, and $\phi^u = 0$. Computing the prolongation coefficients:

> $$\phi^t = D_t(\phi^u) - p D_t(\xi^t) - q D_t(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 1 - q \cdot 0 = -p$$

> $$\phi^x = D_x(\phi^u) - p D_x(\xi^t) - q D_x(\xi^x) = 0 - p \cdot 0 - q \cdot 0 = 0$$

> Therefore, $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - p \frac{\partial}{\partial p}$. Applying this to the solution curve $\gamma(t) = (t,0,e^{-t},-e^{-t},0)$, we find $\frac{d}{dt} \gamma(t) = (1, 0, -e^{-t}, e^{-t}, 0)$ and $\text{pr}^{(1)} V \mid_{\gamma(t)} = (1, 0, 0, e^{-t}, 0)$. The flows match, confirming that time translation is indeed a symmetry of the heat equation.

The prolongation formula transforms the abstract concept of symmetry into a concrete computational tool. By lifting vector fields from the base space to jet space, we can systematically identify all symmetries of a given differential equation.

### Differential Equations as Submanifolds

We arrive at the definition of a differential equation in intrinsic geometry.

A **system of partial differential equations** of order $k$ is a closed submanifold $\mathcal{E} \subset J^k(\pi)$. Usually, $\mathcal{E}$ is defined as the zero set of a smooth function $F: J^k(\pi) \to \mathbb{R}^s$:

$$\mathcal{E} = \{ p \in J^k(\pi) : F(p) = 0 \}$$

A **classical solution** to the differential equation is a section $\phi: M \to E$ such that its $k$-jet graph lies entirely within the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$:

$$j^k \phi(M) \subset \mathcal{E}$$

In the language of Exterior Differential Systems (Chapter 6.3), a solution is an $n$-dimensional integral manifold of the Cartan distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ such that the projection onto $M$ is a local diffeomorphism.

This geometric definition resolves several ambiguities encountered in classical analysis. A solution may exist geometrically as a smooth submanifold of $J^k(\pi)$ but fail to project smoothly onto $M$. These points correspond to gradient catastrophes or shock waves (Chapter 3.2), which are now understood as folding singularities of the projection map $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to M$. For the submanifold $\mathcal{E}$ to admit any integral manifolds, the contact distribution restricted to $\mathcal{E}$ must not be "too small." This leads to formal integrability conditions involving the **symbol** of the differential operator (Chapter 6.2). Initial or boundary data are simply lower-dimensional integral submanifolds. The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem becomes a geometric statement about extending these submanifolds.

> **Heat Equation in Jet Space**

> Consider the heat equation $u_t = u_{xx}$ in 1+1 dimensions. The base manifold is $M = \mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(t,x)$, and the bundle is $E = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ with coordinates $(t,x,u)$. The 1-jet bundle $J^1(\pi)$ has coordinates $(t,x,u,u_t,u_x)$, which we denote as $(t, x, u, p, q)$ where $p = u_t$ and $q = u_x$.

> The contact forms on $J^1(\pi)$ are $\theta^1 = du - p \, dt - q \, dx$ (vertical contact), $\theta^2 = dp - r \, dt$ (temporal contact, where $r = u_{tt}$), and $\theta^3 = dq - s \, dx$ (spatial contact, where $s = u_{xx}$). The heat equation defines a submanifold in $J^2(\pi)$ as $\mathcal{E} = \{ (t,x,u,p,q,r,s) \in J^2(\pi) : s - p = 0 \}$.

> To verify this construction, consider the classical solution $u(t,x) = e^{-t} \cos(x)$. At the point $(t_0,x_0) = (0,0)$, we compute the jet coordinates: $u(0,0) = 1$, $p = u_t(0,0) = -1$, $q = u_x(0,0) = 0$, $r = u_{tt}(0,0) = 1$, and $s = u_{xx}(0,0) = -1$. Checking the constraint $s - p = -1 - (-1) = 0$ confirms that this point lies in $\mathcal{E}$.

> The solution graph $\{(t,x,e^{-t}\cos(x))\}$ projects to a curve in $J^1(\pi)$ given by $\gamma(t) = (t, 0, e^{-t}, -e^{-t}, 0)$. Verifying that $\gamma$ is an integral manifold, we compute $\gamma^*\theta^1 = d(e^{-t}) - (-e^{-t})dt - 0 \cdot dx = -e^{-t}dt + e^{-t}dt = 0$, confirming that the contact structure is preserved along the solution curve.

This example demonstrates how the heat equation, which appears as a second-order PDE in classical analysis, becomes a first-order geometric constraint in jet space. The solution is no longer a function but a curve that satisfies both the contact structure and the equation constraint.

> **Burgers' Equation and Galilean Symmetry**

> For Burgers' equation $u_t + u u_x = \nu u_{xx}$, the 2-jet bundle has coordinates $(t,x,u,p,q,r,s,T,U,V)$ where $p = u_t$, $q = u_x$, $r = u_{tt}$, $s = u_{xx}$, $T = u_{tx}$, $U = u_{xxx}$, and $V = u_{ttt}$. The PDE defines a submanifold $\mathcal{E} = \{ F = p + u q - \nu s = 0 \}$ in $J^2(\pi)$.

> Consider the Galilean boost vector field $V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ on the base space $E$. The first prolongation to $J^1$ yields $\phi^t = D_t(u) - p D_t(x) - q D_t(u) = p - q$ and $\phi^x = D_x(u) - p D_x(x) - q D_x(u) = q - p$, giving $\text{pr}^{(1)} V = x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + (p - q) \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + (q - p) \frac{\partial}{\partial q}$.

> For the second prolongation to $J^2$, computing the coefficient for $r = u_{tt}$ gives $\phi^r = D_t(\phi^t) - r D_t(x) - s D_t(u) = D_t(p - q) - s = (r - T) - s$, where $D_t(p) = r$ and $D_t(q) = T$. The symmetry condition requires that $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = 0$ whenever $F = 0$. Computing $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} \cdot \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} \cdot \phi^x + \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} \cdot q + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \cdot \phi^s = (p - q) + u(q - p) + q - \nu \phi^s$, which reduces to an identity on solutions, confirming Galilean invariance.

The prolongation method systematically identifies all symmetries of a differential equation by lifting vector fields to jet space. This geometric approach reveals symmetries that may not be obvious from the original equation.

> **Non-Integrability of the Cartan Distribution**

> Consider a scalar PDE in 1+1 variables, with $J^1(\pi)$ having coordinates $(x,u,p)$ where $p = u_x$. The contact form is $\theta = du - p \, dx$, and the Cartan distribution is $\mathcal{H} = \ker \theta = \text{span}\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}, \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \}$.

> To demonstrate non-integrability, compute the Lie bracket of $X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$ and $X_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial p}$. The Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_{X_1}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\right) = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + p \frac{\partial}{\partial u}\right] \frac{\partial}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial u} \frac{\partial}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$, so $[X_1, X_2] = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$.

> Checking whether this bracket lies in the distribution, we compute $\langle \theta, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = \langle du - p \, dx, \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \rangle = 1 \neq 0$. Since $[\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H}] \nsubseteq \mathcal{H}$, the distribution is non-holonomic. This non-holonomy is essential: it allows us to reach any point in jet space from any other via curves tangent to $\mathcal{H}$ (Chow-Rashevskii theorem), providing the flexibility needed to construct solutions.

The non-integrability of the Cartan distribution is not a defect but a feature. It ensures that the jet bundle has sufficient structure to encode all possible derivatives while maintaining the constraint that these derivatives must be compatible with the chain rule.

> **Monge-Ampère Equation in Jet Coordinates**

> For the Monge-Ampère equation $\det(D^2 u) = 1$, the jet representation in $J^2(\pi)$ uses coordinates $(x,y,u,p,q,r,s,t)$ where $p = u_x$, $q = u_y$, $r = u_{xx}$, $s = u_{xy}$, and $t = u_{yy}$. The PDE becomes $r t - s^2 = 1$.

> Constructing a formal power series solution $u(x,y) = \sum a_{ij} x^i y^j$, the jet coordinates at the origin $(0,0)$ are $p(0,0) = a_{10}$, $q(0,0) = a_{01}$, $r(0,0) = 2 a_{20}$, $s(0,0) = a_{11}$, and $t(0,0) = 2 a_{02}$. The PDE constraint $(2 a_{20})(2 a_{02}) - a_{11}^2 = 1$ simplifies to $4 a_{20} a_{02} - a_{11}^2 = 1$.

> Choosing $a_{20} = 1/2$ and $a_{02} = 1/2$ gives $4(1/2)(1/2) - a_{11}^2 = 1 - a_{11}^2 = 1$, so $a_{11} = 0$. The solution jet at the origin is $(0,0,u_0,0,0,1,0,1)$. Higher-order terms are determined recursively by compatibility with the contact structure, demonstrating how the jet bundle framework enables systematic construction of formal solutions.

The jet bundle approach transforms the problem of finding solutions into a geometric problem of constructing integral manifolds. This perspective reveals the algebraic structure underlying differential equations and provides a systematic method for analyzing their properties.

> **Characteristic Curves in Jet Space**

> For the first-order PDE $u_x = \sin(x + u)$, the jet coordinates are $(x,u,p)$ with $F(x,u,p) = p - \sin(x + u) = 0$. The characteristic system is given by $\frac{dx}{ds} = F_p = 1$, $\frac{du}{ds} = p F_p = p$, and $\frac{dp}{ds} = -F_x - p F_u = -\cos(x + u) - p \cos(x + u)$.

> With initial data $u(0)=0$ and $p(0)=\sin(0)=0$ at $x=0$, the first equation gives $x(s) = s$. The remaining equations require numerical integration, but the structure is clear: the characteristic curves foliate the solution surface in jet space as $\{(x,u(x),u_x(x))\}$. Along these characteristics, $F$ remains constant (equal to zero), verifying that the characteristic method correctly identifies the solution structure.

The characteristic method in jet space provides a geometric interpretation of the classical method of characteristics. The curves in jet space encode both the solution and its derivatives, providing a complete description of the solution structure.

> **Overdetermined Systems and Compatibility**

> Consider the system $u_{xx} = 0$ and $u_{xy} = 0$. In $J^2(\pi)$, these define submanifolds $\mathcal{E}_1 = \{ r = 0 \}$ and $\mathcal{E}_2 = \{ s = 0 \}$, with the full system given by $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_1 \cap \mathcal{E}_2$.

> Differentiating $\mathcal{E}_1$ along $x$ gives $D_x(r) = 0$, so $u_{xxx} = 0$. Differentiating $\mathcal{E}_2$ along $y$ gives $D_y(s) = 0$, so $u_{xyy} = 0$. On $\mathcal{E}$, we have $r = 0$ (so $u_{xx} = 0$) and $s = 0$ (so $u_{xy} = 0$). The mixed derivatives satisfy $u_{xxy} = D_y(u_{xx}) = D_y(0) = 0$ and $u_{xyx} = D_x(u_{xy}) = D_x(0) = 0$, which are consistent. The system is compatible, with solutions $u(x,y) = ax + by + c$.

> In contrast, the system $u_{xx} = 0$ and $u_{xy} = 1$ is incompatible. We have $D_x(u_{xy}) = u_{xxx} = D_x(1) = 0$ and $D_y(u_{xx}) = u_{xyy} = D_y(0) = 0$, but $u_{xyx} = 1 \neq 0 = u_{xyy}$, creating a contradiction. This demonstrates how the jet bundle framework systematically identifies compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems.

The compatibility analysis in jet space reveals the algebraic structure of overdetermined systems. The failure of compatibility manifests as an inconsistency in the prolongation of the system, providing a geometric criterion for solvability.

> **Minimal Surfaces and Translation Symmetry**

> The minimal surface equation $(1 + u_y^2) u_{xx} - 2 u_x u_y u_{xy} + (1 + u_x^2) u_{yy} = 0$ has the jet representation $F(r,s,t,p,q) = (1 + q^2)r - 2 p q s + (1 + p^2)t = 0$.

> For the translation symmetry $V = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$, computing the second prolongation gives $\phi^u = 0$, $\phi^p = D_x(0) - p D_x(1) = -p$, $\phi^q = D_y(0) - p D_y(1) = 0$, $\phi^r = D_x(\phi^p) - r D_x(1) = D_x(-p) - r = -r$, $\phi^s = D_x(\phi^q) - r D_x(1) - s D_x(1) = 0 - r - s$, and $\phi^t = D_y(\phi^q) - r D_y(1) - s D_y(1) = 0$.

> Applying this to $F$, we compute $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial r} \phi^r + \frac{\partial F}{\partial s} \phi^s + \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \phi^t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} D_x(p) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} D_x(q)$. Detailed computation shows that $\text{pr}^{(2)} V(F) \equiv 0$ on solutions, confirming that $x$-translation is indeed a symmetry of the minimal surface equation.

The symmetry analysis of geometric equations reveals their invariance properties. The prolongation method provides a systematic way to verify these symmetries and understand their implications for the solution structure.
