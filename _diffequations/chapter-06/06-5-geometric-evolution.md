# Section 6.5: Geometric Evolution Equations

## Introduction

The construction of the infinite-dimensional manifold of metrics, $\text{Met}(M)$, in the previous section provides the kinematic arena for geometric analysis. However, the study of static metrics is insufficient for understanding the topological classification of manifolds. To resolve the topological obstructions presented by the Poincaré and Geometrization conjectures, we must introduce dynamics. We seek a canonical deformation of the Riemannian structure—a differential equation where the metric itself is the time-dependent variable, evolving toward a state of constant curvature or high symmetry.

This section covers the parabolic systems governing these deformations, specifically the Ricci flow and the Mean Curvature flow. These are gradient flows of geometric functionals on $\text{Met}(M)$, establishing a rigorous connection between the variational methods of Chapter 2, the entropy principles of Chapter 3, and the stochastic analysis of Chapter 5.

## Mathematical Content

### The Ricci Flow and Parabolicity

The Ricci flow, introduced by Richard Hamilton, allows the metric to evolve in proportion to its Ricci curvature tensor. For a smooth manifold $M$ with a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $g(t)$, the evolution equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} g_{ij} = -2 R_{ij}
$$

Here, $R_{ij}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor. This equation is structurally analogous to the heat equation $\partial_t u = \Delta u$. In harmonic coordinates, the principal symbol of the Ricci tensor is given by $-\frac{1}{2} \Delta g_{ij}$ plus lower-order terms. Thus, the Ricci flow behaves as a nonlinear heat equation for the metric tensor, smoothing out irregularities in curvature.

However, a fundamental analytic difficulty arises: the equation is only weakly parabolic. Due to the diffeomorphism invariance of the curvature (the gauge symmetry discussed in Chapter 6.4), the linearization of the Ricci tensor possesses a degenerate symbol. Solutions are unique only up to diffeomorphism.

To prove short-time existence and uniqueness, one employs the De Turck trick. We modify the flow by a time-dependent diffeomorphism generated by a vector field $W$. By solving the strictly parabolic system:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} g_{ij} = -2 R_{ij} + \nabla_i W_j + \nabla_j W_i
$$

where $W$ is chosen to cancel the degenerate terms of the Ricci tensor in a specific harmonic gauge, we obtain a solution. The geometric flow is then recovered by pulling back via the diffeomorphism. This methodology is covered extensively in Hamilton (1995) and Chow et al. (2004).

### Maximum Principles and Tensor Analysis

The analysis of geometric flows relies heavily on extending the scalar maximum principle to tensor bundles. If the initial metric possesses positive curvature, does the flow preserve this positivity?

For a scalar function $u$ satisfying $\partial_t u \ge \Delta u + F(u)$, the minimum of $u$ is non-decreasing if $F$ satisfies certain reaction conditions. In the context of Ricci flow, the evolution of the full Riemannian curvature tensor $Rm$ follows a reaction-diffusion equation:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} Rm = \Delta Rm + Q(Rm)
$$

Here, $\Delta$ is the Lichnerowicz Laplacian and $Q$ is a quadratic form in the curvature components. To ensure that specific curvature cones (such as non-negative sectional curvature) are preserved, Hamilton developed the Tensor Maximum Principle. This allows for global curvature estimates, ensuring that as the metric evolves, the geometry does not become arbitrarily singular without control.

Furthermore, differential Harnack inequalities provide a mechanism to compare values of the curvature at different points in spacetime. For positive solutions to the heat equation, the Li-Yau-Hamilton inequality constrains the gradient of the solution by its value. These estimates are essential for analyzing the behavior of the flow as it approaches a singularity.

### Perelman's Entropy Functionals

While Hamilton established the analytic foundations, the Ricci flow program faced a critical obstacle: the analysis of singularities. Singularities in nonlinear heat equations can form in finite time (e.g., neck pinches). To understand these, Grisha Perelman introduced a variational structure that interprets the Ricci flow as a gradient flow, analogous to the thermodynamic entropy discussed in Chapter 3.

Perelman defined the $\mathcal{F}$-functional for a metric $g$ and a scalar function $f$ (often interpreted as a dilaton or probability density potential):

$$
\mathcal{F}(g, f) = \int_M (R + |\nabla f|^2) e^{-f} dV_g
$$

subject to the constraint $\int_M e^{-f} dV_g = 1$. The gradient flow of this functional, coupled with the backward heat equation for $f$, yields the Ricci flow for $g$.

Crucially, Perelman proved a monotonicity formula:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{F}(g(t), f(t)) \ge 0
$$

This monotonicity precludes the existence of "breathers" (solutions that oscillate indefinitely) and forces the flow to evolve toward canonical solitons. This result is formally analogous to the H-theorem in the kinetic theory of Chapter 5.7, suggesting a deep link between geometric evolution and statistical mechanics. The quantity $\lambda(g) = \inf_f \mathcal{F}(g,f)$ serves as a spectral lower bound for the geometry.

For detailed singularity analysis, Perelman introduced the $\mathcal{W}$-entropy, which includes a scale parameter $\tau$. This functional is monotonic along the flow and detects the local geometry of shrinking solitons, which model the blow-up of singularities. These concepts are covered extensively in Perelman (2002) and Morgan & Tian (2014).

### Singularities and Surgery

When the curvature becomes unbounded as $t \to T$, the flow must be stopped and modified. This process, known as Ricci flow with surgery, involves identifying the region of high curvature (typically distinct topological components like necks), excising them, and gluing in topologically standard caps of controlled curvature.

The validity of this procedure rests on the Canonical Neighborhood Theorem, which asserts that regions of high scalar curvature in three dimensions are universally modeled by cylinders or caps. By performing surgery and restarting the flow, one can decompose the manifold into pieces that admit standard geometries. This technique provided the analytical engine for the proof of the Geometrization Conjecture.

### Mean Curvature Flow

Parallel to the intrinsic evolution of the metric, we consider the extrinsic evolution of a submanifold $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The Mean Curvature Flow (MCF) moves the submanifold in the direction of its mean curvature vector $\vec{H}$:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} F(x,t) = \vec{H}(F(x,t))
$$

where $F: \Sigma \times [0, T) \to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the embedding. This is the gradient flow of the Area functional. Much like Ricci flow, MCF smooths the submanifold but can develop singularities (pinching off).

A central tool in analyzing MCF is Huisken's monotonicity formula. We consider the backward heat kernel $\Phi$ centered at a point $(x_0, t_0)$ in spacetime. The Gaussian density:

$$
\Theta(t) = \int_{\Sigma_t} \Phi(x_0, t_0, x, t) d\mathcal{H}^n
$$

is monotonically decreasing for $t < t_0$. The limit as $t \to t_0$ defines the density of the singularity, classifying it as a smooth point, a cylinder, or a more complex singularity type. Solitons in this context are self-similar solutions that evolve only by rescaling or translation, known as ancient solutions.

### Stochastic Quantization and the Semiclassical Limit

In the synthesis of Chapter 6 with Chapter 5, we recognize geometric evolution equations as the semiclassical limits of stochastic quantization. As discussed in Chapter 5.6 regarding Regularity Structures, the stochastic quantization of a field theory involves a Langevin equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi} + \xi
$$

where $S$ is the action and $\xi$ is white noise. For gravity, where $S$ is the Einstein-Hilbert action, the deterministic drift term $-\frac{\delta S}{\delta g}$ corresponds to the Ricci tensor (in harmonic gauge). Thus, the Ricci flow $\partial_t g = -2 \text{Ric}$ can be viewed as the zero-noise limit of the stochastic evolution of spacetime geometry. The "singularities" encountered in the deterministic flow—such as topology-changing neck pinches—correspond to phase transitions in the underlying quantum field theory, where the system tunnels between different topological sectors of the moduli space.

## Complete Examples

### Example 6.5.1: Normalized Ricci Flow on $S^2$

**Problem:** Consider the 2-sphere $S^2$ with the standard round metric $g_0 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2$. Show that the normalized Ricci flow admits an exact solution.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Ricci Curvature Computation:**
   For the round metric $g(t) = f(t)^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)$:

   Ricci tensor: $R_{ij} = (1/f(t)^2 - 1) g_{ij}$

   Scalar curvature: $R = 2/f(t)^2$

2. **Normalized Ricci Flow Equation:**
   The normalized flow is:

   $$
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t} g_{ij} = -2 \text{Ric}_{ij} + \frac{r}{n} g_{ij}
   $$

   where $r = \text{tr}_g \text{Ric} = R$. For $n=2$:

   $$
   \frac{\partial f^2}{\partial t} = -2(1 - f^2) + f^2 = 2(f^2 - 1)
   $$

3. **Exact Solution:**
   $$
   \frac{df^2}{dt} = 2(f^2 - 1) \implies \frac{df^2}{f^2 - 1} = 2\, dt
   $$

   Integration:

   $$
   \int \frac{df^2}{f^2 - 1} = 2t + C \implies \tanh^{-1}f = t + C
   $$

   Initial condition $f(0) = f_0$:

   $$
   f(t) = \tanh(t + \tanh^{-1}f_0)
   $$

4. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   As $t \to \infty$: $f(t) \to 1$, converging to standard round metric

   Curvature evolution: $R(t) = 2/f(t)^2 \to 2$ (constant)

   Volume preservation: $\text{Vol}(S^2, g(t)) = 4\pi$ (normalized)

   **Key Insight:** The Ricci flow acts as a nonlinear heat equation that homogenizes curvature while preserving topology.

### Example 6.5.2: De Turck Trick—Making Ricci Flow Strictly Parabolic

**Problem:** Consider the flat torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ with metric $g_{ij}(t)$. Apply the De Turck trick to demonstrate strict parabolicity.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Ricci Flow Linearization:**
   The Ricci flow $\partial_t g = -2\text{Ric}(g)$ has linearization:

   $$
   \mathcal{L} h_{ij} = -\Delta_L h_{ij} + \text{lower order terms}
   $$

   where $\Delta_L$ is the Lichnerowicz Laplacian:

   $$
   \Delta_L h_{ij} = \Delta h_{ij} + 2 R_{ikjl} h^{kl} - 2 R_{ik} h_j^k - 2 R_{jk} h_i^k + 2 R_{ij} \text{tr}_h g
   $$

2. **Gauge Degeneracy:**
   The symbol of $\Delta_L$ is degenerate due to diffeomorphism invariance:

   $$
   \sigma(\Delta_L)(\xi) h_{ij} = -|\xi|^2 h_{ij} + 2\xi_i \xi_k h^k_j + 2\xi_j \xi_k h^k_i
   $$

3. **De Turck Modification:**
   Introduce vector field $W$ solving:

   $$
   \Delta_L W_i + \nabla_j \nabla_i W^j = \Gamma_k(g, \partial_t g)
   $$

   Modified flow:

   $$
   \partial_t g_{ij} = -2\text{Ric}_{ij} + \mathcal{L}_W g_{ij}
   $$

   where $\mathcal{L}_W g_{ij} = \nabla_i W_j + \nabla_j W_i$

4. **Explicit Calculation for Flat Torus:**
   Initial metric: $g_0 = dx^2 + dy^2$

   Perturbation: $h_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix} h_{11} & h_{12} \\ h_{12} & h_{22} \end{pmatrix}$

   De Turck vector: $W = (w_1, w_2)$ where:

   $$
   \Delta w_1 = \partial_x h_{11} + \partial_y h_{12}
   $$

   $$
   \Delta w_2 = 2\partial_x h_{12} + \partial_y h_{22}
   $$

5. **Symbol Analysis:**
   Modified symbol:

   $$
   \sigma(\partial_t g + 2\Delta_L g - \mathcal{L}_W g)(\xi) = |\xi|^2 g_{ij}
   $$

   **Result:** Strictly parabolic with principal symbol $|\xi|^2 > 0$

   **Key Insight:** The De Turck trick transforms a weakly parabolic system into a strictly parabolic one while preserving the geometric content.

### Example 6.5.3: Tensor Maximum Principle—Preservation of Positive Sectional Curvature

**Problem:** Show that positive sectional curvature is preserved under Ricci flow on $S^2$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Curvature Evolution on $S^2$:**
   For metric $g(t) = f(t)^2 g_{\text{round}}$, sectional curvature $K = 1/f(t)^2$. Evolution:

   $$
   \partial_t K = \Delta K + 2K(R - 2K)
   $$

2. **Tensor Maximum Principle Application:**
   General form: For tensor $T$ satisfying:

   $$
   \partial_t T \ge \Delta T + Q(T)
   $$

   where $Q$ is quadratic. If $T \ge 0$ initially and $Q(T) \ge 0$ when $T \ge 0$, then $T(t) \ge 0$.

3. **Verification for Sectional Curvature:**
   Lichnerowicz Laplacian: $\Delta K = f^{-4} \partial_\theta (\sin\theta \partial_\theta K)/\sin\theta$

   Reaction term: $Q(K) = 2K(2/f^2 - 2K)$

   Positivity preservation: If $K \ge 0$, then $Q(K) \ge 0$ when $K \le 1/f^2$

4. **Explicit Verification:**
   From Example 6.5.1: $f(t) = \tanh(t + C)$. Then:

   $$
   K(t) = \frac{1}{f(t)^2} = \frac{1}{\tanh^2(t + C)} = \coth^2(t + C)
   $$

   Check: $\partial_t K = -2\coth^2(t + C) \tanh(t + C) \ge 0$ for $t \ge 0$

   **Key Insight:** Geometric inequalities are preserved through the tensor maximum principle, ensuring controlled evolution.

### Example 6.5.4: Perelman's $\mathcal{F}$-Functional—Monotonicity Proof

**Problem:** Verify Perelman's monotonicity formula for Ricci flow on $S^1$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Setup:**
   Metric: $g(t) = u(x,t) dx^2$, $x \in [0,2\pi]$

   $\mathcal{F}$-functional:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}(u, f) = \int_0^{2\pi} \left( \frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} + \frac{f_x^2}{u} \right) e^{-f} \sqrt{u}\, dx
   $$

2. **Ricci Flow Evolution:**
   Ricci curvature: $\text{Ric} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{u_{xx}}{u^2}$

   Flow: $\partial_t u = u_{xx}$

3. **Coupled Evolution:**
   Perelman's system:

   $$
   \partial_t u = u_{xx}
   $$

   $$
   \partial_t f = -\log u + \text{constant}
   $$

4. **Monotonicity Computation:**
   First variation:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{F} = \int \left[ 2\left|\frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} + \frac{f_x^2}{2u} - 1\right|^2 + \text{boundary terms} \right] e^{-f} \sqrt{u}\, dx
   $$

   Detailed calculation:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{F} = \int \left[ \partial_t \left( \frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} \right) e^{-f} \sqrt{u} + \left( \frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} + \frac{f_x^2}{u} \right) \partial_t \left( e^{-f} \sqrt{u} \right) \right] dx
   $$

   After integration by parts and substitution:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{F} = 2 \int \left| \frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} + \frac{f_x^2}{2u} - 1 \right|^2 e^{-f} \sqrt{u}\, dx \ge 0
   $$

5. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   Equality case: $\frac{u_{xx}}{u^2} + \frac{f_x^2}{2u} = 1$

   Gradient flow structure: Ricci flow = gradient flow of $\mathcal{F}$

   No breathers: Monotonicity prevents periodic solutions

   **Key Insight:** $\mathcal{F}$-monotonicity provides a Lyapunov functional controlling the entire flow.

### Example 6.5.5: Singularity Analysis—Neck Pinch

**Problem:** Construct an explicit solution exhibiting neck pinch singularity in finite time.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Ansatz for Cylinder:**
   Domain: $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ with metric:

   $$
   g(t) = dr^2 + \alpha(r,t)^2 d\theta^2
   $$

2. **Ricci Flow Evolution:**
   Ricci tensor: $\text{Ric} = -\partial_{rr} \log \alpha \cdot g_{\theta\theta}$

   Evolution:

   $$
   \partial_t \alpha = \alpha_{rr}
   $$

3. **Self-Similar Solution:**
   Assume $\alpha(r,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{T-t}} \beta\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{T-t}}\right)$

   Reduced equation:

   $$
   \beta'' + \frac{1}{2} \beta' + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\beta'^2}{\beta} = 0
   $$

4. **Exact Solution:**
   Let $\gamma = \log \beta$. Then:

   $$
   \gamma'' + \frac{1}{2} (\gamma')^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma' = 0
   $$

   Solution: $\gamma' = -\frac{1}{1 + e^{r/\sqrt{2}}}$

   $$
   \beta(r) = \sqrt{2} \tanh\left(\frac{r}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)
   $$

5. **Singularity Analysis:**
   Neck radius: $\alpha(0,t) \sim \sqrt{T-t}$

   Curvature: $R \sim \frac{1}{T-t}$

   Singularity time: $t = T$ (diameter $\to 0$)

6. **Canonical Neighborhood:**
   High curvature region $r \lesssim \sqrt{T-t}$ resembles shrinking cylinder.

   Surgery: Remove $|r| < \epsilon \sqrt{T-t}$, cap with standard spheres.

   **Key Insight:** Neck pinches are universal and admit explicit self-similar models.

### Example 6.5.6: Mean Curvature Flow—Huisken's Monotonicity

**Problem:** Verify Huisken's monotonicity for a shrinking $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **MCF Equation:**
   Embedding: $F(x,t): S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}^n$

   Evolution: $\partial_t F = \vec{H} = -(n-1) F/|F|^2$

2. **Self-Similar Solution:**
   Ansatz: $F(x,t) = \sqrt{T-t} \cdot \phi(x)$

   Reduced MCF:

   $$
   \Delta \phi + \frac{1}{2} \phi = 0
   $$

3. **Huisken Functional:**
   Gaussian density:

   $$
   \Theta(p,t_0) = (4\pi(T-t_0))^{-n/2} \int_{S^{n-1}(t)} e^{-|x-p|^2/4(T-t_0)} d\mathcal{H}^{n-1}
   $$

4. **Monotonicity Computation:**
   Evolution:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \Theta = -\frac{1}{2(4\pi(T-t_0))^{n/2}} \int |\vec{H} + \frac{x-p}{2(T-t_0)}|^2 e^{-|x-p|^2/4(T-t_0)} d\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \le 0
   $$

5. **Asymptotic Analysis:**
   As $t \to T^-$:

   $$
   \lim_{t \to T^-} \Theta(p,T) = \omega_{n-1}
   $$

   where $\omega_{n-1}$ is the solid angle of $S^{n-1}$.

   **Key Insight:** Monotonicity classifies singularities by their asymptotic density.

### Example 6.5.7: Stochastic Quantization Connection

**Problem:** Derive Ricci flow as the mean-field limit of stochastic quantization.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Einstein-Hilbert Action:**
   $$
   S[g] = \int_M R[g] dV_g
   $$

2. **Stochastic Quantization:**
   Langevin equation:

   $$
   \partial_t g_{ij} = -2\text{Ric}_{ij} + \xi_{ij}
   $$

   where $\xi_{ij}$ is space-time white noise:

   $$
   \mathbb{E}[\xi_{ij}(x,t) \xi_{kl}(x',t')] = \delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} \delta(x-x')\delta(t-t')
   $$

3. **Fokker-Planck Equation:**
   Probability density $P[g,t]$:

   $$
   \partial_t P = \int \frac{\delta}{\delta g_{ij}} \left[ \frac{\delta}{\delta g_{ij}} + 2\text{Ric}_{ij} \right] P\, dV_g
   $$

4. **Mean-Field Limit:**
   Averaged evolution:

   $$
   \partial_t \langle g_{ij} \rangle = -2 \langle \text{Ric}_{ij} \rangle
   $$

   Fluctuation-dissipation: Higher moments controlled by Perelman's $\mathcal{W}$-entropy.

5. **Singularity Interpretation:**
   Neck pinch $\leftrightarrow$ Quantum tunneling between topology classes

   Surgery $\leftrightarrow$ Phase transition in path integral measure

   **Key Insight:** Ricci flow emerges as deterministic limit of quantum gravity path integral.
