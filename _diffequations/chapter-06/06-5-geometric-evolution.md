# Section 6.5: Geometric Evolution Equations

## Introduction

We define dynamics on the space of metrics. **Ricci Flow** is presented as the gradient flow of the Einstein-Hilbert action (modified by Perelman entropy). We interpret this flow as the "Drift" term of the stochastic quantization from Chapter 5. We discuss **Singularity Formation** (neck pinches) as topological surgery.
