# Section 6.3: Exterior Differential Systems & Cartan-Kähler

> Differential equations become ideals, and solutions become integral manifolds.

## Introduction

The reformulation of partial differential equations into the language of jet bundles, as established in the preceding sections, allows us to detach the concept of a solution from specific coordinate representations. However, to treat existence and uniqueness systematically—particularly for overdetermined systems where standard analytic tools fail—we require a coordinate-free algebraic framework. This framework is the theory of Exterior Differential Systems (EDS).

In this section, we replace the differential equation with a differential ideal in the exterior algebra. A solution is no longer a function, but an integral manifold of this ideal. This geometric shift allows us to utilize the powerful Cartan-Kähler theorem, which serves as a broad generalization of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem for intrinsic geometries.



### Differential Ideals and Integral Manifolds

The fundamental object of study in this framework is not a system of equations $F(x, u, p) = 0$, but a collection of differential forms that must vanish on any valid solution.

**Definition 6.3.1 (Differential Ideal).** Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A **differential ideal** $\mathcal{I}$ is an algebraic ideal of the graded algebra of differential forms $\Omega^*(M)$ that satisfies two conditions:

1. **Algebraic Closure:** If $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ and $\beta \in \Omega^*(M)$, then $\alpha \wedge \beta \in \mathcal{I}$.

2. **Differential Closure:** If $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$, then $d\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$.

An exterior differential system is a pair $(M, \mathcal{I})$. In the context of PDE theory, the manifold $M$ is typically the jet bundle $J^k(E)$. The ideal $\mathcal{I}$ is generated by:

1. The contact forms $\theta^\alpha = du^\alpha - p^\alpha_i dx^i$, which enforce the geometry of the jet bundle.

2. The $0$-forms (functions) $F^\beta: J^k(E) \to \mathbb{R}$ representing the PDE constraints.

3. The exterior derivatives of these forms, required to satisfy differential closure.

The condition of differential closure ($d\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{I}$) is crucial. It encapsulates all integrability conditions and hidden constraints obtained by differentiating the original system, analogous to the prolongation procedures discussed in Section 6.2.

**Definition 6.3.2 (Integral Manifold).** An **integral manifold** of an exterior differential system $(M, \mathcal{I})$ is a submanifold $N \subset M$ and an immersion $\iota: N \hookrightarrow M$ such that the pullback of every form in the ideal vanishes:

$$
\iota^* \alpha = 0 \quad \text{for all } \alpha \in \mathcal{I}.
$$

For a PDE system, a classical solution corresponds to an integral manifold that is transverse to the projection $\pi: J^k(E) \to X$ (the independent variables). This definition unifies various classes of differential equations; for instance, Frobenius' theorem is simply the study of integral manifolds for an ideal generated entirely by 1-forms. The geometric machinery of differential ideals is covered extensively in Olver (1995) and Spivak (1979).

### Integral Elements and the Cartan Test

To construct integral manifolds, we proceed pointwise. We essentially construct the solution by assembling "valid tangent planes" at every point.

**Definition 6.3.3 (Integral Element).** A linear subspace $E \subset T_p M$ is an **integral element** of $\mathcal{I}$ if for all $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$:

$$
\alpha(v_1, \dots, v_k) = 0 \quad \text{for all } v_1, \dots, v_k \in E.
$$

The set of all $k$-dimensional integral elements at $p$ forms a subset of the Grassmannian $Gr_k(T_p M)$. Constructing a solution involves finding a sequence of integral elements $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \dots \subset E_n$ (a flag) and integrating them into a manifold.

The obstruction to extending an integral element $E_k$ to a higher dimension $E_{k+1}$ is measured by the **polar space**.

**Definition 6.3.4 (Polar Space).** Let $E$ be an integral element at $p$. The polar space $H(E)$ is the set of vectors $v \in T_p M$ such that $\text{span}(E \cup \{v\})$ remains an integral element.

The dimension of the polar space determines the freedom we have in extending the solution. Cartan introduced a set of integers $s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n$, known as **Cartan characters**, to quantify this freedom. The character $s_k$ roughly counts the number of new constraints appearing at dimension $k$.

**Theorem 6.3.1 (Cartan's Test for Involutivity).** An exterior differential system is **involutive** (or regular) at an integral element $E_n$ if the dimension of the polar space satisfies a specific equality relating to the Cartan characters. Specifically, if $c_n$ is the codimension of the integral element manifold in the Grassmannian, involutivity requires:

$$
\text{dim } V_n(E) = \sum_{k=1}^n k s_k.
$$

In simpler terms, a system is involutive if there are no algebraic obstructions to constructing the solution flag step-by-step. If the test fails, the system is singular or requires prolongation to expose further constraints. This linear algebraic criterion for solvability is a central result in Olver (1995).

### The Cartan-Kähler Theorem

The Cartan-Kähler theorem is the fundamental existence result for exterior differential systems. It establishes that if a system is algebraically consistent (involutive) and the data is real-analytic, local solutions are guaranteed to exist.

**Theorem 6.3.2 (Cartan-Kähler).** Let $(M, \mathcal{I})$ be a real-analytic exterior differential system. Let $P \subset M$ be a connected, $k$-dimensional analytic integral manifold. If the system is involutive along $P$, then there exists a unique, local, analytic $(k+1)$-dimensional integral manifold $N$ containing $P$.

By induction, this allows for the construction of integral manifolds of dimension $n$ (solutions to the PDE).

**Proof Concept:**

The proof relies on the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem (Covered in Evans, 2010). The Cartan test ensures that we can choose a coordinate system where the exterior differential system can be rewritten as a determined system of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya type evolution equations. The step-by-step extension of integral elements $E_k \to E_{k+1}$ corresponds to solving a sequence of analytic Cauchy problems.

**Significance:**

1. **Generality:** It applies to undetermined, determined, and overdetermined systems alike, provided they are involutive.

2. **Geometric Nature:** It constructs the solution strictly from the geometry of the ideal $\mathcal{I}$, independent of the choice of independent/dependent variables.

3. **Analyticity Constraint:** Like Cauchy-Kovalevskaya, it requires analytic data. It cannot guarantee existence for $C^\infty$ (smooth) data; systems that satisfy Cartan-Kähler but fail for smooth data usually exhibit Lewy-type instabilities.

This theorem represents the pinnacle of local existence theory for geometric PDEs. It resolves the question of existence by reducing it to a linear algebra problem (computing ranks of polar matrices to check involutivity) and a check of analyticity. When the system is not involutive, one must prolong the system (differentiate the ideal) until it becomes involutive or contradictory, a process known as the Cartan-Kuranishi prolongation algorithm.

> **The Classical Gradient Ideal**

> To find all functions $u: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $u_x = f(x,y)$ for a given smooth function $f$, we construct an exterior differential system on $M = \mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(x,y,u)$. The system is generated by $\mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = du - f(x,y)dx \}$.

> Verifying differential closure, we compute $d\theta = d(du - f dx) = -df \wedge dx = -(f_x dx + f_y dy) \wedge dx = -f_y dy \wedge dx = f_y dx \wedge dy$. To check if $d\theta \in \mathcal{I}$, we express $d\theta = f_y dx \wedge dy = f_y dx \wedge (du - \theta) = f_y dx \wedge du - f_y dx \wedge \theta$. Since $dx \wedge \theta \in \mathcal{I}^{(2)} = \{ \alpha \wedge \beta \mid \alpha \in \mathcal{I}, \beta \in \Omega^*(M) \}$, the ideal is differentially closed.

> An integral manifold $N \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ satisfies $\iota^*\theta = 0$ where $\iota: N \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$. Parametrizing $N$ by $(x,y)$ gives $u = u(x,y)$, so $du = u_x dx + u_y dy$. Then $\iota^*\theta = (u_x dx + u_y dy) - f dx = (u_x - f)dx + u_y dy = 0$, yielding the Pfaffian system $u_x = f(x,y)$ and $u_y = 0$. The solution is $u(x,y) = \int_0^x f(t,y) dt + c$, where the constant is determined by the constraint $u_y = 0$. Solutions are graphs of functions whose $x$-derivative matches $f$, demonstrating how the exterior differential system encodes the differential equation geometrically.

> **Incompressible Flow**

> To find all divergence-free vector fields $\mathbf{v} = (P,Q)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we construct an exterior differential system on $M = \mathbb{R}^4$ with coordinates $(x,y,P,Q)$. The EDS is $\mathcal{I} = \{ \omega = P_y - Q_x \}$.

> Verifying differential closure, we compute $d\omega = d(P_y - Q_x) = P_{yx} dx \wedge dy - Q_{xy} dy \wedge dx = 0$ since $P_{yx} = Q_{xy}$ by equality of mixed partials. Thus $d\omega = 0 \in \mathcal{I}$.

> At each point $(x_0,y_0,P_0,Q_0)$, an integral element $E \subset T_{(x_0,y_0,P_0,Q_0)}M$ satisfies $\omega(v_1,v_2) = 0$ for all $v_1,v_2 \in E$. The condition $P_y = Q_x$ constrains the $(x,y)$-directions. Integral manifolds are surfaces where $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y)$ satisfy $\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}$.

> Setting $P(x,y) = \int_0^y f(x,t) dt + g(x)$ gives $Q_x = P_y = f(x,y)$, so $Q(x,y) = \int_0^x f(s,y) ds + h(y)$. The general solution is $\mathbf{v} = \nabla^\perp \psi$ for some stream function $\psi$, demonstrating how the exterior differential system encodes the divergence-free condition as a geometric constraint.

> **Surface of Revolution PDE**

> To solve $z_{xy} = F(x,y,z,z_x,z_y)$ for a surface $z = z(x,y)$, we construct an exterior differential system on $M = J^1(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R})$ with coordinates $(x,y,z,p,q)$. The ideal is $\mathcal{I} = \left\{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \quad \omega = dp \wedge dx + dq \wedge dy - F dx \wedge dy \right\}$.

> The contact structure $\theta = 0$ enforces $(p,q) = (z_x,z_y)$. To find integral elements, we seek 2-planes $E \subset T_{(x,y,z,p,q)}M$ such that $\theta \mid_E = 0$ and $\omega \mid_E = 0$. An integral element must lie in $\ker \theta$, spanned by $v_1 = \partial_x + p \partial_z$, $v_2 = \partial_y + q \partial_z$, $v_3 = \partial_p$, and $v_4 = \partial_q$. Evaluating $\omega$ on this distribution gives $\omega(v_1,v_2) = \omega(\partial_x + p\partial_z, \partial_y + q\partial_z) = -F \neq 0$ unless $F = 0$.

> The corrected integral elements are $E = \text{span}\{v_1,v_2\}$ where $v_1 = \partial_x + p \partial_z + a \partial_p + b \partial_q$ and $v_2 = \partial_y + q \partial_z + c \partial_p + d \partial_q$. The polar space $H(E)$ consists of vectors $w$ such that $\text{span}(E \cup \{w\})$ remains integral. Computing $\omega(v_1,v_2) = 0$, $\omega(v_1,w) = 0$, and $\omega(v_2,w) = 0$ gives a $2 \times 4$ matrix whose rank determines involutivity. The Cartan characters are $s_0 = 1$ (freedom in $z$ direction) and $s_1 = 1$ (freedom in $(p,q)$ plane). The involutivity condition is $\dim V_2(E) = 2s_1 + 1s_2 = 3$. If the rank condition holds, the system is involutive.

> **Monge-Ampère Equation**

> For the Monge-Ampère equation $z_{xx}z_{yy} - z_{xy}^2 = 1$, the exterior differential system is $\mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp - r dx - s dy, \omega_2 = dq - s dx - t dy, \omega_3 = r t - s^2 - 1 \}$.

> At a generic point, the integral element is $E_2 = \text{span}\{\partial_x + p\partial_z + r\partial_p + s\partial_q, \partial_y + q\partial_z + s\partial_p + t\partial_q\}$. Solving $\omega_i(E_2,v) = 0$ for $i=1,2,3$ determines the polar vectors. The freedom count gives $s_0 = 1$ (initial $z$), $s_1 = 2$ (initial $(p,q)$), and $s_2 = 0$ (second derivatives determined). Verification shows $\dim V_2 = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 0 = 2$, confirming the system is involutive.

> **Goursat Problem for Nonlinear Wave Equation**

> To solve $u_{xy} = f(x,y,u,u_x,u_y)$ with initial data $u(x,0) = \phi(x)$ and $u(0,y) = \psi(y)$, we construct an exterior differential system on $M = J^1(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R})$ with coordinates $(x,y,u,p,q)$. The ideal is $\mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = du - p dx - q dy, \omega = dp \wedge dy - f dx \wedge dy \}$.

> Verifying involutivity, integral elements at $(x_0,y_0,u_0,p_0,q_0)$ are $E = \text{span}\{v_1 = \partial_x + p_0 \partial_u + a \partial_p + b \partial_q, v_2 = \partial_y + q_0 \partial_u + c \partial_p + d \partial_q\}$. The conditions $\theta(v_1) = \theta(v_2) = 0$ are automatic, and $\omega(v_1,v_2) = 0$ gives $\omega(v_1,v_2) = -f + (d - b) = 0$, so $d = b$. The polar space has dimension 3 parameters $(a,b,c)$. The Cartan characters are $s_0 = 1$ and $s_1 = 1$, and involutivity is satisfied since $\dim V_2 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$.

> Applying Cartan-Kähler, the initial manifold $P_1$ along $y=0$ has $u = \phi(x)$, $p = \phi'(x)$, and $q$ free. Extending to $P_2$, we solve for $q(x,0)$ using $\omega \mid_P = 0$, giving $dp \wedge dy = f dx \wedge dy$, which implies $\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \bigg\mid_{y=0} = f(x,0,\phi(x),\phi'(x),q)$. This yields an ODE for $q(x,0)$: $\frac{dq}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \phi''(x) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}$. Assuming $f$ is analytic, Cauchy-Kovalevskaya guarantees a local solution, and Cartan-Kähler ensures a unique analytic extension to the $(x,y)$-plane with dimension increasing from $P_1 \to P_2$.

> **Overdetermined System Failure**

> For the system $u_{xx} = 0$ and $u_{xy} = 0$ (incompatible unless $u_{yy} = 0$), the exterior differential system is $\mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp, \omega_2 = dp \wedge dy \}$.

> The Cartan test gives $E_2 = \text{span}\{\partial_x + p\partial_z, \partial_y + q\partial_z\}$. The condition $\omega_1(\partial_x + p\partial_z, v) = 0$ for all $v$ requires $dp = 0$ on the entire $T M$. The obstruction is $\dim V_2 = 0 < 1$, so the system is not involutive. Prolongation adds $d\omega_2 = 0$, which implies $d^2p = 0$, revealing the full Laplace equation.

> **Surfaces with Constant Gaussian Curvature**

> To find all surfaces with Gaussian curvature $K = 1$, we construct an exterior differential system in $J^2$: $\mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp - r dx - s dy, \omega_2 = dq - s dx - t dy, \omega_3 = (r t - s^2) - 1 \}$.

> The complete Cartan analysis gives characters $s_0 = 1$, $s_1 = 1$, and $s_2 = 0$. The system is involutive (standard result). The solutions are spheres $x^2 + y^2 + (z-a)^2 = R^2$. Cartan-Kähler constructs these spheres from initial curves with correct first and second fundamental forms, demonstrating how the exterior differential system framework systematically generates geometric solutions.
