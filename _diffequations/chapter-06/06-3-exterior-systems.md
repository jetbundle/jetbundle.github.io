# Section 6.3: Exterior Differential Systems & Cartan-Kähler

## Introduction

The reformulation of partial differential equations into the language of jet bundles, as established in the preceding sections, allows us to detach the concept of a solution from specific coordinate representations. However, to treat existence and uniqueness systematically—particularly for overdetermined systems where standard analytic tools fail—we require a coordinate-free algebraic framework. This framework is the theory of Exterior Differential Systems (EDS).

In this section, we replace the differential equation with a differential ideal in the exterior algebra. A solution is no longer a function, but an integral manifold of this ideal. This geometric shift allows us to utilize the powerful Cartan-Kähler theorem, which serves as a broad generalization of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem for intrinsic geometries.

## Mathematical Content

### Differential Ideals and Integral Manifolds

The fundamental object of study in this framework is not a system of equations $F(x, u, p) = 0$, but a collection of differential forms that must vanish on any valid solution.

**Definition 6.3.1 (Differential Ideal).** Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A **differential ideal** $\mathcal{I}$ is an algebraic ideal of the graded algebra of differential forms $\Omega^*(M)$ that satisfies two conditions:

1. **Algebraic Closure:** If $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ and $\beta \in \Omega^*(M)$, then $\alpha \wedge \beta \in \mathcal{I}$.

2. **Differential Closure:** If $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$, then $d\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$.

An exterior differential system is a pair $(M, \mathcal{I})$. In the context of PDE theory, the manifold $M$ is typically the jet bundle $J^k(E)$. The ideal $\mathcal{I}$ is generated by:

1. The contact forms $\theta^\alpha = du^\alpha - p^\alpha_i dx^i$, which enforce the geometry of the jet bundle.

2. The $0$-forms (functions) $F^\beta: J^k(E) \to \mathbb{R}$ representing the PDE constraints.

3. The exterior derivatives of these forms, required to satisfy differential closure.

The condition of differential closure ($d\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{I}$) is crucial. It encapsulates all integrability conditions and hidden constraints obtained by differentiating the original system, analogous to the prolongation procedures discussed in Section 6.2.

**Definition 6.3.2 (Integral Manifold).** An **integral manifold** of an exterior differential system $(M, \mathcal{I})$ is a submanifold $N \subset M$ and an immersion $\iota: N \hookrightarrow M$ such that the pullback of every form in the ideal vanishes:

$$
\iota^* \alpha = 0 \quad \text{for all } \alpha \in \mathcal{I}.
$$

For a PDE system, a classical solution corresponds to an integral manifold that is transverse to the projection $\pi: J^k(E) \to X$ (the independent variables). This definition unifies various classes of differential equations; for instance, Frobenius' theorem is simply the study of integral manifolds for an ideal generated entirely by 1-forms. The geometric machinery of differential ideals is covered extensively in Olver (1995) and Spivak (1979).

### Integral Elements and the Cartan Test

To construct integral manifolds, we proceed pointwise. We essentially construct the solution by assembling "valid tangent planes" at every point.

**Definition 6.3.3 (Integral Element).** A linear subspace $E \subset T_p M$ is an **integral element** of $\mathcal{I}$ if for all $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$:

$$
\alpha(v_1, \dots, v_k) = 0 \quad \text{for all } v_1, \dots, v_k \in E.
$$

The set of all $k$-dimensional integral elements at $p$ forms a subset of the Grassmannian $Gr_k(T_p M)$. Constructing a solution involves finding a sequence of integral elements $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \dots \subset E_n$ (a flag) and integrating them into a manifold.

The obstruction to extending an integral element $E_k$ to a higher dimension $E_{k+1}$ is measured by the **polar space**.

**Definition 6.3.4 (Polar Space).** Let $E$ be an integral element at $p$. The polar space $H(E)$ is the set of vectors $v \in T_p M$ such that $\text{span}(E \cup \{v\})$ remains an integral element.

The dimension of the polar space determines the freedom we have in extending the solution. Cartan introduced a set of integers $s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n$, known as **Cartan characters**, to quantify this freedom. The character $s_k$ roughly counts the number of new constraints appearing at dimension $k$.

**Theorem 6.3.1 (Cartan's Test for Involutivity).** An exterior differential system is **involutive** (or regular) at an integral element $E_n$ if the dimension of the polar space satisfies a specific equality relating to the Cartan characters. Specifically, if $c_n$ is the codimension of the integral element manifold in the Grassmannian, involutivity requires:

$$
\text{dim } V_n(E) = \sum_{k=1}^n k s_k.
$$

In simpler terms, a system is involutive if there are no algebraic obstructions to constructing the solution flag step-by-step. If the test fails, the system is singular or requires prolongation to expose further constraints. This linear algebraic criterion for solvability is a central result in Olver (1995).

### The Cartan-Kähler Theorem

The Cartan-Kähler theorem is the fundamental existence result for exterior differential systems. It establishes that if a system is algebraically consistent (involutive) and the data is real-analytic, local solutions are guaranteed to exist.

**Theorem 6.3.2 (Cartan-Kähler).** Let $(M, \mathcal{I})$ be a real-analytic exterior differential system. Let $P \subset M$ be a connected, $k$-dimensional analytic integral manifold. If the system is involutive along $P$, then there exists a unique, local, analytic $(k+1)$-dimensional integral manifold $N$ containing $P$.

By induction, this allows for the construction of integral manifolds of dimension $n$ (solutions to the PDE).

**Proof Concept:**

The proof relies on the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem (Covered in Evans, 2010). The Cartan test ensures that we can choose a coordinate system where the exterior differential system can be rewritten as a determined system of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya type evolution equations. The step-by-step extension of integral elements $E_k \to E_{k+1}$ corresponds to solving a sequence of analytic Cauchy problems.

**Significance:**

1. **Generality:** It applies to undetermined, determined, and overdetermined systems alike, provided they are involutive.

2. **Geometric Nature:** It constructs the solution strictly from the geometry of the ideal $\mathcal{I}$, independent of the choice of independent/dependent variables.

3. **Analyticity Constraint:** Like Cauchy-Kovalevskaya, it requires analytic data. It cannot guarantee existence for $C^\infty$ (smooth) data; systems that satisfy Cartan-Kähler but fail for smooth data usually exhibit Lewy-type instabilities.

This theorem represents the pinnacle of local existence theory for geometric PDEs. It resolves the question of existence by reducing it to a linear algebra problem (computing ranks of polar matrices to check involutivity) and a check of analyticity. When the system is not involutive, one must prolong the system (differentiate the ideal) until it becomes involutive or contradictory, a process known as the Cartan-Kuranishi prolongation algorithm.

## Complete Examples

### Example 6.3.1: Canonical Example—The Classical Gradient Ideal

**Problem:** Find all functions $u: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $u_x = f(x,y)$ for a given smooth function $f$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS Construction:**
   Consider $M = \mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(x,y,u)$. The exterior differential system is generated by:

   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = du - f(x,y)dx \}
   $$

2. **Verify Differential Closure:**
   Compute $d\theta$:

   $$
   d\theta = d(du - f dx) = -df \wedge dx = -\left(f_x dx + f_y dy\right) \wedge dx = -f_y dy \wedge dx
   $$

   Since $dy \wedge dx = -dx \wedge dy$, we have:

   $$
   d\theta = f_y dx \wedge dy
   $$

   Is $d\theta \in \mathcal{I}$? We need to check if $f_y dx \wedge dy$ can be expressed using $\theta$ and wedge products:

   $$
   d\theta = f_y dx \wedge dy = f_y dx \wedge (du - \theta) = f_y dx \wedge du - f_y dx \wedge \theta
   $$

   Since $dx \wedge \theta \in \mathcal{I}$, we only need $f_y dx \wedge du \in \mathcal{I}$. This requires:

   $$
   \mathcal{I}^{(2)} = \{ \alpha \wedge \beta \mid \alpha \in \mathcal{I}, \beta \in \Omega^*(M) \}
   $$

   Thus $dx \wedge \theta \in \mathcal{I}^{(2)}$, so $\mathcal{I}$ is differentially closed.

3. **Integral Manifolds:**
   An integral manifold $N \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ satisfies $\iota^*\theta = 0$, where $\iota: N \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$. Parametrize $N$ by $(x,y)$:

   $$
   u = u(x,y) \implies du = u_x dx + u_y dy
   $$

   Then:

   $$
   \iota^*\theta = (u_x dx + u_y dy) - f dx = (u_x - f)dx + u_y dy = 0
   $$

   This gives the Pfaffian system:

   $$
   \begin{cases}
   u_x = f(x,y) \\
   u_y = 0
   \end{cases}
   $$

4. **Solution:**
   $u(x,y) = \int_0^x f(t,y) dt + g(y)$, but $u_y = 0$ implies $g'(y) = 0$, so:

   $$
   u(x,y) = \int_0^x f(t,y) dt + c
   $$

   **Geometric Interpretation:** Solutions are graphs of functions whose $x$-derivative matches $f$.

### Example 6.3.2: Physical Application—Incompressible Flow

**Problem:** Find all divergence-free vector fields $\mathbf{v} = (P,Q)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS Construction:**
   $M = \mathbb{R}^4$ with coordinates $(x,y,P,Q)$. The EDS is:

   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \omega = P_y - Q_x \}
   $$

2. **Differential Closure:**
   $$
   d\omega = d(P_y - Q_x) = P_{yx} dx \wedge dy - Q_{xy} dy \wedge dx = 0
   $$

   Since $P_{yx} = Q_{xy}$ (equality of mixed partials), $d\omega = 0 \in \mathcal{I}$.

3. **Integral Elements:**
   At each point $(x_0,y_0,P_0,Q_0)$, find $E \subset T_{(x_0,y_0,P_0,Q_0)}M$ such that:

   $$
   \omega(v_1,v_2) = 0 \quad \forall v_1,v_2 \in E
   $$

   The condition $P_y = Q_x$ constrains the $(x,y)$-directions. Integral manifolds are surfaces where:

   $$
   P(x,y), Q(x,y) \text{ satisfy } \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
   $$

4. **Complete Solution:**
   Set $P(x,y) = \int_0^y f(x,t) dt + g(x)$.

   Then $Q_x = P_y = f(x,y)$.

   Integrate: $Q(x,y) = \int_0^x f(s,y) ds + h(y)$.

   **General solution:** $\mathbf{v} = \nabla^\perp \psi$ for some stream function $\psi$.

### Example 6.3.3: Advanced Demonstration—Surface of Revolution PDE

**Problem:** Solve $z_{xy} = F(x,y,z,z_x,z_y)$ for a surface $z = z(x,y)$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS Construction:**
   $M = J^1(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R})$ with coordinates $(x,y,z,p,q)$. The ideal is:

   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \left\{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \quad \omega = dp \wedge dx + dq \wedge dy - F dx \wedge dy \right\}
   $$

2. **Contact Structure:**
   $\theta = 0$ enforces $(p,q) = (z_x,z_y)$.

3. **Integral Elements:**
   Find 2-planes $E \subset T_{(x,y,z,p,q)}M$ such that:
   - $E$ annihilates $\theta$: $\theta|_E = 0$
   - $E$ annihilates $\omega$: $\omega|_E = 0$

   Basis for $T M$: $\partial_x, \partial_y, \partial_z, \partial_p, \partial_q$

   **Condition 1:** $\theta(\partial_x) = -p$, $\theta(\partial_y) = -q$, $\theta(\partial_z) = 1$

   An integral element must lie in $\ker \theta$, spanned by:

   $$
   v_1 = \partial_x + p \partial_z, \quad v_2 = \partial_y + q \partial_z, \quad v_3 = \partial_p, \quad v_4 = \partial_q
   $$

   **Condition 2:** Evaluate $\omega$ on this distribution:

   $$
   \omega(v_1,v_2) = \omega(\partial_x + p\partial_z, \partial_y + q\partial_z) = -F
   $$

   Thus $\omega(v_1,v_2) = -F \neq 0$ unless $F = 0$.

4. **Corrected Integral Elements:**
   We need $E = \text{span}\{v_1,v_2\}$ where:

   $$
   v_1 = \partial_x + p \partial_z + a \partial_p + b \partial_q
   $$

   $$
   v_2 = \partial_y + q \partial_z + c \partial_p + d \partial_q
   $$

5. **Cartan Test Application:**
   The polar space $H(E)$ consists of vectors $w$ such that $\text{span}(E \cup \{w\})$ remains integral. Compute:

   $$
   \omega(v_1,v_2) = 0, \quad \omega(v_1,w) = 0, \quad \omega(v_2,w) = 0
   $$

   This gives a $2 \times 4$ matrix whose rank determines involutivity.

   **Cartan characters:** $s_0 = 1$ (freedom in $z$ direction), $s_1 = 1$ (freedom in $(p,q)$ plane)

   **Involutivity Condition:**

   $$
   \dim V_2(E) = 2s_1 + 1s_2 = 2 + 1 = 3
   $$

   If the rank condition holds, the system is involutive.

### Example 6.3.4: Monge-Ampère Equation

**Problem:** $z_{xx}z_{yy} - z_{xy}^2 = 1$ (special case).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS:**
   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp - r dx - s dy,
   $$

   $$
   \omega_2 = dq - s dx - t dy, \omega_3 = r t - s^2 - 1 \}
   $$

2. **Cartan Test Computation (at generic point):**
   **Integral element:** $E_2 = \text{span}\{\partial_x + p\partial_z + r\partial_p + s\partial_q, \partial_y + q\partial_z + s\partial_p + t\partial_q\}$

   **Polar vectors:** Solve $\omega_i(E_2,v) = 0$ for $i=1,2,3$

   **Freedom count:** $s_0 = 1$ (initial $z$), $s_1 = 2$ (initial $(p,q)$), $s_2 = 0$ (second derivatives determined)

3. **Verification:**
   $\dim V_2 = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 0 = 2$, involutive.

### Example 6.3.5: Complete Local Existence—Goursat Problem

**Problem:** Solve the nonlinear wave equation:

$$
u_{xy} = f(x,y,u,u_x,u_y)
$$

**Initial Data:** $u(x,0) = \phi(x)$, $u(0,y) = \psi(y)$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS Construction:**
   $M = J^1(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R})$, coordinates $(x,y,u,p,q)$

   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = du - p dx - q dy, \omega = dp \wedge dy - f dx \wedge dy \}
   $$

2. **Verify Involutivity:**
   Integral elements at $(x_0,y_0,u_0,p_0,q_0)$:

   $E = \text{span}\{v_1 = \partial_x + p_0 \partial_u + a \partial_p + b \partial_q,$

   $v_2 = \partial_y + q_0 \partial_u + c \partial_p + d \partial_q\}$

   **Conditions:** $\theta(v_1) = \theta(v_2) = 0$ (automatic), $\omega(v_1,v_2) = 0$

   Compute:

   $$
   \omega(v_1,v_2) = \omega(\partial_x,\partial_y) + \text{terms involving } a,b,c,d = -f + (d - b)
   $$

   Set $d = b$. Polar space dimension: 3 parameters $(a,b,c)$.

   **Cartan characters:** $s_0 = 1$, $s_1 = 1$

   **Involutivity:** $\dim V_2 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$, satisfied.

3. **Cartan-Kähler Application:**
   **Initial manifold $P_1$:** Along $y=0$, $u = \phi(x)$, $p = \phi'(x)$, $q$ free.

   **Extension to $P_2$:** Solve for $q(x,0)$ using $\omega|_P = 0$:

   $$
   dp \wedge dy = f dx \wedge dy \implies \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\bigg|_{y=0} = f(x,0,\phi(x),\phi'(x),q)
   $$

   This is an ODE for $q(x,0)$:

   $$
   \frac{dq}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \phi''(x) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}
   $$

4. **Analytic Solution (assuming $f$ analytic):**
   By Cauchy-Kovalevskaya, local solution exists. Cartan-Kähler guarantees:
   - Unique analytic extension to $(x,y)$-plane
   - Dimension increases: $P_1 \to P_2$ (full solution)

5. **Explicit Verification for $f = u u_x u_y$:**
   Initial data: $\phi(x) = x^2$, $\psi(y) = y^2$

   Along $y=0$: $p = 2x$, solve $q_x = 2x \cdot q$

   $q(x,0) = c e^{x^2}$

   Full solution constructed iteratively.

### Example 6.3.6: Overdetermined System—Failure Case

**Problem:** $u_{xx} = 0$, $u_{xy} = 0$ (incompatible unless $u_{yy} = 0$).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS:**
   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp, \omega_2 = dp \wedge dy \}
   $$

2. **Cartan Test:**
   $E_2 = \text{span}\{\partial_x + p\partial_z, \partial_y + q\partial_z\}$

   $\omega_1(E_2, \cdot)$: $\omega_1(\partial_x + p\partial_z, v) = 0$ for all $v$

   **Polar space:** Requires $dp = 0$ on entire $T M$

3. **Obstruction:**
   $\dim V_2 = 0 < 1$ (not involutive).

4. **Prolongation:**
   Add $d\omega_2 = 0 \implies d^2p = 0$, revealing full Laplace equation.

### Example 6.3.7: Sophus Lie's Contact System

**Problem:** Find all surfaces with Gaussian curvature $K = 1$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **EDS (in $J^2$):**
   $$
   \mathcal{I} = \{ \theta = dz - p dx - q dy, \omega_1 = dp - r dx - s dy,
   $$

   $$
   \omega_2 = dq - s dx - t dy, \omega_3 = (r t - s^2) - 1 \}
   $$

2. **Complete Cartan Analysis:**
   **Characters:** $s_0 = 1$, $s_1 = 1$, $s_2 = 0$

   **Involutive:** Yes (standard result)

3. **Solutions:**
   Spheres $x^2 + y^2 + (z-a)^2 = R^2$

   **Geometric Insight:** Cartan-Kähler constructs spheres from initial curves with correct first/second fundamental forms.
