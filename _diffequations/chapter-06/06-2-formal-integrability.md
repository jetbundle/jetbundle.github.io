# Section 6.2: Formal Integrability & Spencer Cohomology

## Introduction

We define the **Symbol** of a PDE as a geometric object. We introduce **Spencer Cohomology** to measure the formal obstructions to solving the equation (compatibility conditions). We define **Involution** as the algebraic state where no hidden obstructions exist.
