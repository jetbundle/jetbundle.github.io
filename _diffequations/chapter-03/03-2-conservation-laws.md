# Section 3.2: Systems of Conservation Laws & Hyperbolicity

## Introduction

We move to dynamical fields. **Conservation Laws** are expressed as the divergence of flux. We define **Hyperbolicity** and the **Method of Characteristics** for systems. We demonstrate the breakdown of classical solutions: even smooth initial data can evolve into singularities (**Shocks**) in finite time, proving that the smoothness recovered in Ch 2.5 is not generic for nonlinear hyperbolic systems.
