# Section 3.5: Continuum Mechanics & Elasticity

## Introduction

We apply the geometric framework to matter. The unknown is a deformation map between manifolds. We define **Stress Tensors** (Piola-Kirchhoff vs. Cauchy) and formulate PDEs based on **Frame Indifference** and **Hyperelasticity**. This demonstrates that the geometric structure of the equations is constrained by physical symmetry principles.
