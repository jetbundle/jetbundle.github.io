# Section 3.3: Entropy Solutions & Shock Theory

## Introduction

Characteristics show that nonlinear hyperbolic flows convert smooth data into vertical gradients in finite time. The differential form $\partial_{t}u + \nabla \cdot f(u) = 0$ ceases to make classical sense at the breaking time, yet the integral balance law remains valid. By enlarging the solution space to distributions we retain conservation, but weak solutions are non-unique. Physical irreversibility must be reintroduced analytically via **entropy conditions**. This section derives the Rankine–Hugoniot jump relation, explains why weak formulations alone fail, and presents Lax’s entropy admissibility, entropy–entropy flux pairs, Kruzhkov’s $L^{1}$-contraction theory, and constructive schemes such as Glimm’s method.
