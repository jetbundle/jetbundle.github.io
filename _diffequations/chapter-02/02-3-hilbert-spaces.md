# Section 2.3: Hilbert Space Theory & Spectral Theorem

## Introduction

We visualize functions as vectors in an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space. We develop the geometry of **Hilbert Space** (orthogonality, projection). The central result is the **Spectral Theorem for Compact Self-Adjoint Operators**, which provides the rigorous justification for the "separation of variables" and series expansions employed heuristically in Chapter 1.4.
