# Section 2.4: Unbounded Operators, Resolvents & Semigroups

## Introduction

Physical operators like the Laplacian are unbounded (differentiation roughens functions). We introduce the domain subtleties of **Self-Adjointness** versus Symmetricity. We construct the **Resolvent Operator** and use **Stone's Theorem** to define time evolution ($e^{itH}$) as a unitary group, providing a rigorous foundation for Quantum Mechanics without relying on convergent power series.
