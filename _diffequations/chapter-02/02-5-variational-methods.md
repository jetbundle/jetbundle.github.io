# Section 2.5: Variational Methods & Lax-Milgram

## Introduction

We reframe PDE solving as energy minimization. The **Lax-Milgram Theorem** provides a robust "existence machine" for solving $Lu=f$ by proving the coercivity of the associated bilinear form. We prove **Weyl's Lemma**, showing that abstract weak solutions to elliptic problems are actually smooth classical solutions.
