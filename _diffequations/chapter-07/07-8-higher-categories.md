# Section 7.8: Higher Categories, Derived Stacks & TQFT

## Introduction

The final resolution. We address the singular moduli spaces of Ch 6 by treating them as **Derived Stacks**. We frame physics as a **Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)**—a functor from the category of cobordisms to vector spaces. The differential equation has dissolved; only the categorical structure remains.
