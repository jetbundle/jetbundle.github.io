# Computation Stack

**Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**

The Computation Stack traces the lineage from military command and control requirements to modern surveillance and artificial intelligence systems.

## Overview

The foundational mathematics (graph theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry) was funded to solve specific intelligence and command problems, then "laundered" through academic abstraction into "pure" computer science.

## Core Components

### [Operating Systems →](/computation_stack/01_intro/#operating-systems)

From Project MAC to Azure IL5 - the modern OS is a direct descendant of 1960s military requirements.

### [Artificial Intelligence →](/computation_stack/ai-audit/)

From ALVINN to Palantir - neural networks funded by ONR and DARPA for autonomous vehicle navigation.

### [Graph Theory →](/computation_stack/graph-theory/)

From Turán to SKYNET to Palantir Gotham - combinatorics and graph algorithms for intelligence applications.
