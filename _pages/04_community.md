# Join the Bundle

We are building a community of high-knowledge, high-skilled individuals who collaborate, research, and innovate through mastery of **Physics, Finance, and Computation**.

## Mission

The goal of `jetbundle` is to attract and cultivate a community that:

- **Masters the fundamentals**: Physics, Finance, and Computation as the core disciplines for 21st-century scientists and engineers
- **Builds freely**: Creates open-source tools, simulations, and research
- **Thinks independently**: Free thinking, free building, engineering excellence
- **Flourishes**: Eudaimonia through knowledge, collaboration, and innovation
