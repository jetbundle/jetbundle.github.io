# The Master Cartography: Mathematics

The mathematical foundations of modern science, mapped to their material origins and modern applications.

## The Base Space

The "Base Space" of mathematics maps directly onto the applied "Fibers" of technology. The CS and QF curricula are not new subjects; they are bundles of these mathematical tools, optimized for a specific set of problems.

## Part I: The Base Space (The Cartography)

The most effective map of the Base Space remains Vladimir Arnold's 1995 tripartition. It is not a philosophy, but a verifiable econometric model of 20th-century R&D.

### Cryptography (The "Enigma")

Funded by intelligence agencies ("CIA, KGB and the like"), this pillar generated the demand for:

- Number theory
- Algebraic geometry over finite fields
- Algebra

### Hydrodynamics (The "Submarine")

Supported by "manufacturers of atomic submarines," this pillar procreated:

- Complex analysis
- Partial differential equations
- Scientific computing

### Celestial Mechanics (The "Missile")

Financed by "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA," this pillar was the origin of:

- Dynamical systems
- Linear algebra
- Topology
- Variational calculus

## The Laundering Mechanism

The "pure," axiomatic formalism of collectives like Nicolas Bourbaki (est. 1934) was the crucial "laundering" mechanism. It provided the intellectual camouflage necessary to resolve the central contradiction of the post-WWII era: how to accept secret military funding while maintaining a public identity of "pure," apolitical inquiry.

Abstraction became the mechanism of redaction.
