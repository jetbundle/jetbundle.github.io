## Our Mission

**Mapping the hidden geometry of modern science.**

This project is an open-source audit that maps the hidden geometry of modern science. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline, documenting how defense-driven innovation flows into modern engineering practice.

## How to Contribute

### Submit an Audit

Want to contribute a new "Fiber" audit? Here's how:

1. **Fork the repository** [jetbundle.github.io](https://github.com/jetbundle/jetbundle.github.io)
2. **Create a new blog post** in the `_posts/` directory
3. **Follow the audit methodology:**
   - Identify the "Base Space" (the academic abstraction)
   - Trace the "Fiber" (the applied, material problem)
   - Document the "Connection" (the funding pipeline)
   - Provide verifiable sources and citations
4. **Submit a pull request** with your audit

### Submit a Resource

Have a declassified document, grant record, or recommended reading? 

1. **Open an issue** or **submit a pull request**
2. **Include:**
   - The document or resource
   - Proper citations
   - Context about its relevance
   - Verification of authenticity
3. **We'll review** and add it to the [Resources](/resources/) page

### Contribute to Simulations

Want to build open-source simulations of the mathematical foundations?

1. **Check out** the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/jetbundle)
2. **Create a new repository** for your simulation
3. **Follow the coding standards:**
   - Clear documentation
   - Verifiable mathematical implementations
   - Educational focus
4. **Submit for inclusion** in the resources
