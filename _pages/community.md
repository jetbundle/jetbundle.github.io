# Community

## Our Mission

`jetbundle` is an open-source initiative to map the hidden geometry of modern science. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline: from classified military requirements to academic abstraction to modern engineering practice.

Our mission is to remove the redactions. The audit trail is the curriculum.

## How to Join

### Join the Discussion

We welcome discussions, questions, and contributions from researchers, engineers, and anyone interested in tracing the defense-academic pipeline.

**[Join GitHub Discussions →](https://github.com/jetbundle/jetbundle.github.io/discussions)**

### Explore the Code

The `jetbundle` project includes open-source simulations and code to explore the "lemmas" (Kalman filters, Turán graphs, Byzantine consensus).

## How to Contribute

### Submit an Audit

We welcome new "Fiber" audits that trace defense-driven innovation to modern engineering practice. To submit an audit:

1. **Write your audit** as a blog post in the `_posts/` directory.
2. **Follow the format** of existing audits (see the [Computation Stack](/computation_stack/01_intro/), [Physics Stack](/physics_stack/01_intro/), or [Finance Stack](/finance_stack/01_intro/)).
3. **Submit a pull request** to the `jetbundle.github.io` repository.
4. **Include proper citations** and verifiable sources.

### Submit a Resource

To add a resource (book, document, or primary source) to the [Resources](/resources/) page:

1. **Prepare your resource** with proper citations and descriptions.
2. **Edit the `_pages/resources.md` file** to add your resource.
3. **Submit a pull request** with your changes.

### Submit Code

To contribute code (simulations, analyses, or tools):

1. **Create a repository** in the `jetbundle` GitHub organization (or your own fork).
2. **Document your code** with clear README files and examples.
3. **Link to your repository** from the relevant stack page or blog post.
4. **Submit a pull request** to add the link to the main site.
