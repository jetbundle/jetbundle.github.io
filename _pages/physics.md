# Physics Stack

**Naval Warfare & Missile Guidance**

The Physics Stack maps the Base Space of mathematics (complex analysis, PDEs, scientific computing) to its material origins in submarine design, ballistic trajectories, and nuclear weapons development.

## Overview

Funded by ONR, DARPA, and AFOSR for applications in submarine design, missile guidance, and nuclear weapons development.

## Core Components

### [Complex Analysis →](/physics_stack/01_intro/#complex-analysis)

From *Nautilus* hulls to aircraft wings - conformal mapping for hydrodynamic optimization.

### [Partial Differential Equations →](/physics_stack/hydrodynamics/)

From H-bomb shock-waves to hypersonic vehicles - numerical methods for fluid dynamics.

### [Scientific Computing →](/physics_stack/celestial-mechanics/)

From Los Alamos to stockpile simulations - computational methods for physical systems.
