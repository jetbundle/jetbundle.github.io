# Finance Stack

**The Great Handover: Wall Street Outbids the Pentagon**

Quantitative finance did not invent new mathematics; it "re-skinned" the DoD's toolkit for a new problem set: the market.

## Overview

This stack traces the migration of mathematical techniques from military applications to financial markets. The same algorithms used for missile guidance, radar signal processing, and naval warfare are now the foundation of quantitative finance.

## Core Components

### [Kalman Filter →](/finance_stack/01_intro/#kalman-filter)

From missile guidance to time-series analysis - the essential tool for filtering signal from noise.

### [Options Pricing →](/finance_stack/qf-audit/)

From ballistic trajectories to derivatives pricing - Pontryagin's Principle and optimal control theory.

### [High-Frequency Trading →](/finance_stack/hft-audit/)

From radar signal processing to microwave networks - low-latency systems and market microstructure.
