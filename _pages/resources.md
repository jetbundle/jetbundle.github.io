# Resources

A collection of computational tools, interactive modules, and structured learning paths.

## Start Here: Differential Equations

The **language of mathematical physics** begins with differential equations.

**Recommendation**: Start with [A Survey of Differential Equations and their Algebraic Geometry](/diffequations/) (Infrastructure in development)

This complete modern treatment covers:
- Classical theory (ODEs, PDEs)
- Stochastic analysis (SDEs, SPDEs)
- Geometric methods (rough paths, regularity structures)

**Why start here**: Differential equations are the foundation for understanding:
- Physics (motion, fields, waves)
- Engineering (control systems, continuum mechanics)
- Computational science (numerical methods, simulation)
- Financial engineering (pricing, risk management)

### Computational Science

### Financial Engineering (Quantitative Finance)
*(Coming soon)*

## The Learning Path

**Foundations first**: Mathematics and physics provide the essential structure for understanding modern systems.

1. **Master differential equations** - The language of change and dynamics
2. **Understand computational methods** - How to simulate andd calculate reality
3. **Apply to engineering** - Build systems that work

## Why This Order Matters

**Computers don't create understanding** - they execute instructions.

**Modern financial systems** - were engineered by mathematicians and physicists.

**True capability** comes from:
- Knowing the mathematical structure and physical principles first
- Then learning how to compute with it
- Finally applying it to real problems

## What's Coming Soon

**Computational Science**
- Numerical methods
- Scientific computing
- High-performance computing
- Machine learning foundations

**Financial Engineering**
- Stochastic calculus for finance
- Derivative pricing
- Risk management
- Algorithmic trading

## How to Use These Resources

1. **Start with Differential Equations**
2. **Work through the notebooks sequentially**
3. **Run the code yourself**
4. **Build your own extensions**
5. **Join the community discussion (comming soon)**

## The Commitment

These modules represent many hours of work - built independently and designed for self-directed mastery.

**This is not a course. This is a laboratory.**

**Build capability. Solve hard problems. Discover new connections.**
