# The Library

**The Initial Conditions.**

> "We choose the path of maximum density: deep dives into seminal works and original manuscripts themselves."

This is not a reading list. This is a path. Each book builds on the previous. Each concept prepares for the next.

## The Path

### 0. Philosophical Mathematics

*We begin with nothing. No points, no numbers, no space.*

* **A Logical Introduction to Proof** — David A. Schmidt

* **Sets for Mathematics** — F. William Lawvere & Robert Rosebrugh (structural/category-theoretic sets)

### 1. Continuum Analysis

*Zeno's paradoxes are resolved not by motion, but by the static adversarial game of epsilon-delta limits.*

* **Understanding Analysis** — Stephen Abbott

* **Complex Analysis** — Lars Ahlfors

* **Measure, Lebegue Integrals, and Hilbert Spaces** — Kolmogorov & Fomin

* **Probability with Martingales** — David Williams

### 2. Invariance Algebra

*From invariance we derive vector spaces, operators, tensors, and Lie groups.*

* **Linear Algebra** — Georgi Shilov

* **Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations** — Brian C. Hall

* **Algebra** — Serge Lang

### 3. Geometry & Representation

*Geometry is born locally flat, measured by holes, and transcended in algebraic geometry.*

* **Topology and Groupoids** — Ronald Brown

* **Lectures on Differential Geometry** — Shlomo Sternberg

* **Linear Algebra & Geometry** — Alexei I. Kostrikin & Yu. I. Manin

* **Riemann Surfaces** — Simon Donaldson

* **Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology** — Raoul Bott & Loring W. Tu

* **Algebraic Geometry** — Robin Hartshorne

* **A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology** — J. Peter May

* **Vertex Operator Algebras and the Monster** — Igor Frenkel, James Lepowsky, Arne Meurman

### 4. Mathematical Physics

*Physics is rebuilt without Newtonian crutches: symplectomorphisms replace conservation, connections replace forces.*

* **Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics** — Vladimir I. Arnold

* **Foundations of Differential Geometry** — Katsumi Nomizu & Shoshichi Kobayashi

* **Geometry of Yang-Mills Fields** — Michael Atiyah

* **Renormalization and Effective Field Theory** — Kevin Costello

* **Geometric Quantization** — N. M. J. Woodhouse
