# The Library

**The Initial Conditions.**

> "Strong foundation takes priority over any applied field."

This is not a reading list. This is a path. Each book builds on the previous. Each concept prepares for the next. Follow the sequence. Master the fundamentals. Then build.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Follow the sequence.** Each section builds on the previous.
2. **Work through the proofs.** Don't just read—verify.
3. **Join the Discord.** The main work happens in discussion.
4. **Check the GitHub repos.** See implementations and exercises.
5. **Watch the videos.** The YouTube playlist complements the books.

**This is not a course. This is a laboratory.**

Build capability. Solve hard problems. Discover new connections.
