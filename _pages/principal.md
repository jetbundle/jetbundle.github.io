## Principal

This site is a **subject-centered technical resource**, not a personal blog.

### Focus

- Historical origins of applied disciplines
- Post-academic engineering applications
- Defense-academic pipeline

### Methodology

The `jetbundle` project applies a forensic audit methodology to trace the materialist origins of modern science:

1. **Identify the "Killer App"** - The classified, high-stakes problem that drove research
2. **Trace the "First Cheque"** - The original funding source and grant records
3. **Map the "Connection"** - How funding shaped the development of "pure" mathematics
4. **Document the "Migration"** - How applications moved across disciplines
5. **Record the "18-Year Lag"** - The declassification timeline from memo to syllabus
