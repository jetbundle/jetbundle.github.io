# The Master Cartography: Mathematics

The mathematical foundations of modern science, mapped to their material origins and modern applications.

## The Base Space

The "Base Space" of mathematics maps directly onto the applied "Fibers" of technology. The CS and QF curricula are not new subjects; they are bundles of these mathematical tools, optimized for a specific set of problems.

| Field (MSC 2020) | "First Cheque" (Verifiable Program) | Killer App (1940–90) | Modern Patron (2020–) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number Theory** | ONR Project 47D4-2 (1948) | NSA rotor permutations (SIGABA) | NSA GHARDY; JPMorgan |
| **Algebraic Geometry** | DARPA IPTO (1963) | Error-correcting codes | DARPA FUNLoC; Palantir |
| **Complex Analysis** | ONR (1940s) | *Nautilus* submarine hull design | Naval architecture; aerospace |
| **PDEs** | Los Alamos (1940s) | H-bomb shock-waves | Hypersonic vehicles; stockpile stewardship |
| **Dynamical Systems** | NASA (1960s) | Apollo guidance | Space exploration; financial modeling |
| **Graph Theory** | NSA (1970s) | SKYNET drone targeting | Palantir Gotham; social networks |
| **Linear Algebra** | ARO (1960s) | Minuteman-III guidance | Machine learning; quantitative finance |
| **Topology** | ONR (1950s) | Network survivability | Internet infrastructure; distributed systems |
| **Variational Calculus** | NASA (1960s) | Optimal control | Robotics; options pricing |

## The Three Pillars

### Cryptography (The "Enigma")

Funded by intelligence agencies, this pillar generated the demand for:
- Number theory
- Algebraic geometry over finite fields
- Algebra

### Hydrodynamics (The "Submarine")

Supported by manufacturers of atomic submarines, this pillar procreated:
- Complex analysis
- Partial differential equations
- Scientific computing

### Celestial Mechanics (The "Missile")

Financed by institutions dealing with missiles (NASA), this pillar was the origin of:
- Dynamical systems
- Linear algebra
- Topology
- Variational calculus
