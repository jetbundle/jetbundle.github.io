**Mapping the hidden geometry of modern science.**

## Preamble: The Bundle as the True Architecture

This project is an audit. It maps the hidden geometry of modern science.

The premise of `jetbundle` is that mathematics, physics, computer science, and finance are not independent disciplines. They are components of a single, unified structure—a **fiber bundle**—whose geometry is dictated by patronage.

In this model:

1. **The Base Space** is "pure" academia: the university curriculum, the syllabus, the textbook, the journal paper. It is the world of abstract, "unmotivated" definitions—the "ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics" that Vladimir Arnold identified.

2. **The Fiber** is the world of classified, high-stakes, material applications. It is the *actual problem* a given abstraction was funded to solve. At the point on the Base Space labeled "Complex Analysis," the attached Fiber contains the classified blueprints for a *Nautilus* submarine hull. At "Graph Theory," the Fiber contains the NSA's SKYNET drone-targeting algorithm.

3. **The Connection** is the flow of funding. This connection—the grants from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), DARPA, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)—defines the "curvature" of the entire system. It dictates how and why the "pure" research of the Base Space is forced to bend to serve the applied needs of the Fiber.

This site is the open-source audit of that structure. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline.

## The Fibers (The Applied Stacks)

The applied stacks trace defense-driven innovation to modern engineering practice. For detailed information on each stack, see the [Resources](/resources/) page.

### [The C3I & Surveillance Stack →](/c3i_stack/01_intro/)

**Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**

- Operating Systems: From Project MAC to Azure IL5
- Artificial Intelligence: From ALVINN to Palantir
- Graph Theory: From Turán to SKYNET to Palantir Gotham

### [The Ballistics & Hydrodynamics Stack →](/physics_stack/01_intro/)

**Naval Warfare & Missile Guidance**

- Complex Analysis: From *Nautilus* hulls to aircraft wings
- PDEs: From H-bomb shock-waves to hypersonic vehicles
- Scientific Computing: From Los Alamos to stockpile simulations

### [The Military-Financial Stack →](/finance_stack/01_intro/)

**The Great Handover: Wall Street Outbids the Pentagon**

- Kalman Filter: From missile guidance to time-series analysis
- Pontryagin's Principle: From ballistic trajectories to options pricing
- High-Frequency Trading: From radar signal processing to microwave networks

## The Base Space (The Cartography)

The mathematical foundations mapped to their material origins and modern applications.

### The Master Cartography Table

The "Base Space" of mathematics maps directly onto the applied "Fibers" of technology. The CS and QF curricula are not new subjects; they are bundles of these mathematical tools, optimized for a specific set of problems.

| Field (MSC 2020) | "First Cheque" (Verifiable Program) | Killer App (1940–90) | Modern Patron (2020–) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number Theory** | ONR Project 47D4-2 (1948) | NSA rotor permutations (SIGABA) | NSA GHARDY; JPMorgan |
| **Algebraic Geometry** | DARPA IPTO (1963) | Error-correcting codes | DARPA FUNLoC; Palantir |
| **Combinatorics** | ONR (1967) | NSA clique detection (metadata) | Citadel; Two Sigma |
| **Complex Analysis** | ONR (1945-1950) | Conformal mapping (*Nautilus* hull) | Boeing (wing stress) |
| **PDEs** | AEC/ONR (1950) | Shock-wave tables (H-bomb) | Lockheed (hypersonics) |
| **Sci. Computing** | ONR Math Branch (1946) | FEM grids (Los Alamos) | NVIDIA (stockpile sims) |
| **Dynamical Systems** | NASA NGR-40-002-015 | Apollo mid-course (Kalman) | SpaceX (Starship burn) |
| **Linear Algebra** | AFOSR (1954) | Kalman implementation (Minuteman-III) | Google (PageRank) |
| **Variational Calculus** | AFOSR (1949-1950) | Optimal Titan-II trajectory | Blue Origin (landing) |
| **Probability** | ONR (1947) | SONAR tracking (*Nautilus*) | Meta (recommenders) |
| **Graph Theory** | ONR (1967) | SKYNET centrality (drone targets) | Palantir Gotham (ICE) |
| **Optimization** | AFOSR Project SCOOP (1947) | SAC bomber refueling | Amazon (routing) |

### Part I: The Base Space (The Cartography)

The most effective map of the Base Space remains Vladimir Arnold's 1995 tripartition. It is not a philosophy, but a verifiable econometric model of 20th-century R&D.

- **Cryptography (The "Enigma"):** Funded by intelligence agencies ("CIA, KGB and the like"), this pillar generated the demand for number theory, algebraic geometry over finite fields, and algebra.

- **Hydrodynamics (The "Submarine"):** Supported by "manufacturers of atomic submarines," this pillar procreated complex analysis, partial differential equations, and scientific computing.

- **Celestial Mechanics (The "Missile"):** Financed by "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA," this pillar was the origin of dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, and variational calculus.

### The Laundering Mechanism

The "pure," axiomatic formalism of collectives like Nicolas Bourbaki (est. 1934) was the crucial "laundering" mechanism. It provided the intellectual camouflage necessary to resolve the central contradiction of the post-WWII era: how to accept secret military funding while maintaining a public identity of "pure," apolitical inquiry.

Abstraction became the mechanism of redaction.

## Part II: The Connection (The Dynamics of the Stack)

The "Connection" (funding) is not static; it is a dynamic force that pulls ideas across the Base Space and through time.

### The "Migratory App"

A "killer app" migrates across academic disciplines, pulled by patronage. The **Kalman Filter** is the archetype.

1. **Probability (ONR):** Funded as a *probabilistic* tool for SONAR contact tracking.
2. **Dynamical Systems (NASA):** Adopted as a *navigational* tool for Apollo.
3. **Linear Algebra (ARO):** Funded as a *computational* tool for the Minuteman-III.

### The "18-Year Lag"

This is the "declassification by syllabus."

1. **The "Memo" (c. 1978):** Leslie Lamport's **Byzantine Generals Problem** is created as an explicit parable for a DARPA C3 (Command, Control, Communications) requirement: a survivable nuclear command network.

2. **The "Lemma" (c. 1999):** Lamport wins the Turing Award, cementing the problem as a "pure," abstract concept in distributed systems.

3. **The "Syllabus" (c. 2017):** The problem appears in the MIT 6.033 syllabus, its nuclear-war origins fully redacted.

## Part III: The `jetbundle` Project

This project is the open-source initiative to map this bundle. The `jetbundle.github.io` site serves as the primer, the audit trail, and the central hub.

- **The Archive** ([Primary Sources →](/resources/#primary-sources)) contains the declassified memos, booklists, and primary sources.
- **The Audits** ([The Stacks →](/resources/#the-stacks)) apply this forensic methodology to new fields.
- **The Simulations** provide open-source code to explore the "lemmas" (Kalman filters, Turán graphs, Byzantine consensus).

The goal is to remove the redactions. The audit trail is the curriculum.
