**Mapping the hidden geometry of modern science.**

## Preamble: The Bundle as the True Architecture

This project is an audit. It maps the hidden geometry of modern science.

The premise of `jetbundle` is that mathematics, physics, computer science, and finance are not independent disciplines. They are components of a single, unified structure—a **fiber bundle**—whose geometry is dictated by patronage.

In this model:

1. **The Base Space** is "pure" academia: the university curriculum, the syllabus, the textbook, the journal paper. It is the world of abstract, "unmotivated" definitions—the "ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics" that Vladimir Arnold identified.

2. **The Fiber** is the world of classified, high-stakes, material applications. It is the *actual problem* a given abstraction was funded to solve. At the point on the Base Space labeled "Complex Analysis," the attached Fiber contains the classified blueprints for a *Nautilus* submarine hull. At "Graph Theory," the Fiber contains the NSA's SKYNET drone-targeting algorithm.

3. **The Connection** is the flow of funding. This connection—the grants from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), DARPA, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)—defines the "curvature" of the entire system. It dictates how and why the "pure" research of the Base Space is forced to bend to serve the applied needs of the Fiber.

This site is the open-source audit of that structure. We trace the "memo-to-lemma" pipeline.
