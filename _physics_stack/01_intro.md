# The Ballistics & Hydrodynamics Stack

This stack traces the lineage from naval warfare and missile guidance to modern computational physics and engineering.

## Overview

The Physics Stack maps the Base Space of mathematics (complex analysis, PDEs, scientific computing) to its material origins in submarine design, ballistic trajectories, and nuclear weapons development.

## Core Components

### Complex Analysis

Funded by ONR for conformal mapping of *Nautilus* submarine hulls to minimize hydrodynamic noise vortices.

**The Problem**: Submarine hull design to minimize acoustic signature
**The Math**: Conformal mapping, complex analysis
**The Application**: Stealth submarine design
**Modern Application**: Aircraft wing design, hydroelectric turbines

### Partial Differential Equations

Funded for H-bomb shock-wave calculations and hypersonic vehicle design.

**The Problem**: Modeling nuclear explosions and hypersonic flight
**The Math**: PDEs, numerical methods
**The Application**: Nuclear weapons design, missile trajectories
**Modern Application**: Hypersonic vehicle design, climate modeling

### Scientific Computing

Funded for Los Alamos implosion simulations and modern stockpile stewardship.

**The Problem**: Nuclear weapons simulations
**The Math**: Finite element methods, numerical linear algebra
**The Application**: Weapons design and testing
**Modern Application**: Stockpile stewardship, materials science
