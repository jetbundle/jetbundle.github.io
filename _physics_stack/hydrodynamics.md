# Hydrodynamics Audit: From Nautilus to Modern Fluid Dynamics

## The Problem: Submarine Stealth

The *USS Nautilus* (SSN-571), the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, required hull design to minimize hydrodynamic noise—specifically, vortices in the water flow that could be detected by sonar.

## The First Cheque: ONR

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded research on conformal mapping and complex analysis to solve this problem.

### The Mathematical Solution

- **Method**: Conformal mapping
- **Application**: Hull shape optimization
- **Objective**: Minimize vortices and acoustic signature
- **Funding**: ONR (1945-1950)

### Key Research

- **Periscope Vibrations Report** (1948) - ONR research on hydrodynamic effects
- **Conformal Mapping Studies** - Mathematical techniques for hull design
- **Acoustic Research** - Underwater sound propagation

## The Connection to Modern Applications

The same mathematical techniques (conformal mapping, complex analysis) are now used for:

- **Aircraft wing design**: Minimize drag and optimize lift
- **Hydroelectric turbines**: Maximize efficiency
- **Ship hull design**: Modern naval architecture
- **Wind turbine design**: Renewable energy applications

## The Migration

**1940s-1950s**: ONR funds submarine hull design
**1960s-1970s**: Techniques applied to aircraft design
**1980s-1990s**: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) emerges
**2000s-2020s**: Applied to renewable energy and aerospace

## Key Documents

- **ONR Hydrodynamic Research Reports** - Declassified submarine design documents
- **Conformal Mapping Papers** - Mathematical foundations
- **Modern CFD Applications** - Contemporary uses
