# Graph Theory: From Turán to SKYNET

## The Origin

Pál Turán's 1941 "brick factory problem" was conceived in a forced-labor camp. The math (extremal graph theory) was later operationalized by the NSA.

## SKYNET

The NSA's **SKYNET** program uses graph centrality algorithms on metadata to find "cliques" of "suspect activity" for drone targeting.

## Palantir Gotham

This *exact* social network analysis is the core product of **Palantir Gotham**, sold to clients like ICE and the NYPD.

## The Mathematical Connection

Graph theory provides the "skeleton key" for C3I operations—from network analysis to target identification.
