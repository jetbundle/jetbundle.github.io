# Graph Theory Audit: From Turán to SKYNET to Palantir Gotham

## The Origin: Pál Turán's "Brick Factory Problem" (1941)

Pál Turán's 1941 "brick factory problem" was conceived in a forced-labor camp. The problem: minimize the number of crossings in a graph representing a factory layout.

### The Mathematical Foundation

- **Problem**: Given a bipartite graph, minimize edge crossings
- **Solution**: Extremal graph theory
- **Significance**: Foundation for modern graph algorithms

## The Military Application: NSA SKYNET

The NSA's **SKYNET** program operationalized graph theory for intelligence purposes:

### SKYNET Program

- **Objective**: Identify "suspect activity" from metadata
- **Method**: Graph centrality algorithms on communication networks
- **Application**: Drone targeting based on social network analysis
- **Technology**: Clique detection, centrality measures, community detection

### The Algorithm

1. **Build Graph**: Nodes = individuals, Edges = communications
2. **Calculate Centrality**: Identify "important" nodes
3. **Detect Cliques**: Find communities of interest
4. **Target Selection**: Prioritize high-centrality nodes in suspicious cliques

## Modern Application: Palantir Gotham

**Palantir Gotham** is the commercial product that implements this exact methodology:

### Palantir Gotham

- **Technology**: Graph-based social network analysis
- **Clients**: ICE, NYPD, military and intelligence agencies
- **Application**: Law enforcement, surveillance, targeting
- **Method**: Same graph centrality algorithms as SKYNET

### The Connection

The same mathematical techniques (graph theory, centrality algorithms, clique detection) developed for NSA SKYNET are now sold as commercial software by Palantir to government agencies.
