# AI Audit: From ALVINN to Palantir

## The 1980s Revival

The 1980s neural net revival was funded by ONR and DARPA. The "Killer App" was **ALVINN** (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network), a 3-layer backpropagation network built to drive an autonomous HUMVEE.

## Modern Applications

The "Modern Patrons," **Palantir** and **Anduril**, are operationalizing this 1980s R&D for AI-driven drone swarms and targeting systems.

## The Connection

The same mathematical foundations—backpropagation, neural networks, optimization—that enabled autonomous vehicles in the 1980s now power modern surveillance and targeting systems.
