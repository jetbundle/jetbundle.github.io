# OS Audit: From SAC Command Nets to Azure IL5

## The Military Requirement

The modern operating system emerged from a specific military requirement: a "Survivable SAC command net" capable of withstanding nuclear attack.

## Project MAC and Multics

J.C.R. Licklider, as director of DARPA's IPTO, funded MIT's **Project MAC** to build **Multics**—the ancestor of all modern operating systems.

## The Lineage

This 60-year institutional lineage is unbroken: the "Modern Patron" is the same DoD, which now leases this "computer utility" from Microsoft, whose **Azure Kubernetes Service** is formally authorized for **DoD Impact Level 5 (IL5)** workloads.
