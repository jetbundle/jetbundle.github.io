# The C3I & Surveillance Stack

This stack comprises the technologies of **Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence**.

## Overview

The C3I stack represents the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and intelligence operations. It traces the evolution from military command networks to modern surveillance systems.

## Key Components

### Operating Systems

The modern OS is a direct descendant of the 1960s military requirement for a "Survivable SAC command net". J.C.R. Licklider, as director of DARPA's IPTO, executed this mandate by funding MIT's **Project MAC**—the project that built **Multics**, the ancestor of all modern OS.

### Artificial Intelligence

The 1980s neural net revival was funded by ONR and DARPA. The "Killer App" was **ALVINN** (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network), a 3-layer backpropagation network built to drive an autonomous HUMVEE.

### Graph Theory

This is the "skeleton key" Fiber for C3I. Its origin is Pál Turán's 1941 "brick factory problem," conceived in a forced-labor camp. The math (extremal graph theory) was operationalized by the NSA in its **SKYNET** program.
