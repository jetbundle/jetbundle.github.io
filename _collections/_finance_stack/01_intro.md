# The Military-Financial Stack

## The Great Handover

The "Great Handover" occurred when Wall Street outbid the Pentagon. Quantitative finance did not invent new mathematics; it "re-skinned" the DoD's toolkit for a new problem set: the market.

## Key Migrations

### Missile Guidance → Time-Series Analysis

The **Kalman Filter** was funded by the AFOSR in 1954 and was the "essential" GNC tool for the Apollo program and the Minuteman-III ICBM. This is now the quintessential tool for filtering a "true" asset signal from "noisy" market data.

### Ballistics → Derivatives Pricing

**Pontryagin's Maximum Principle** (1956) was funded by AFOSR to solve the "optimal Titan-II ascent trajectory." This is now "re-skinned" to solve the Black-Scholes **PDE** for option pricing.

### Naval Warfare → High-Frequency Trading

HFT firms like Jane Street and Citadel compete in "latency arbitrage" using the same signal-processing algorithms developed for radar and submarine design.
