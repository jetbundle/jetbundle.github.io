# QF Audit: The Mathematics of Markets

## The Translation

Quantitative finance did not invent new mathematics; it "re-skinned" the DoD's toolkit for a new problem set: the market.

## Key Translations

### Kalman Filter

From missile guidance to time-series analysis. The same mathematical tool used for Apollo mid-course corrections is now used to filter market signals.

### Pontryagin's Principle

From ballistics to derivatives pricing. The optimal control theory developed for missile trajectories is now used to solve the Black-Scholes PDE.

## The Stony Brook Curriculum

The Stony Brook QF curriculum is a perfect audit trail of this translation, showing how military mathematics became financial mathematics.
