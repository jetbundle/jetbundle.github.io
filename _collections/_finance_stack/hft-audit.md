# HFT Audit: The Race on Speed

## The Problem

HFT firms like Jane Street and Citadel compete in "latency arbitrage"—a "race on speed" where microseconds determine profit.

## The Math

`AMS 523: Mathematics of High Frequency Finance` teaches "Fourier transforms" and "conformal mapping"—the same math used for radar signal processing and submarine hull design.

## The Physical Infrastructure

HFT firms *physically build a graph* of "terrestrial microwave networks" to find the "shortest-path (geodesic)", running the *same* signal-processing algorithms to win a microsecond race.

## The Connection

The mathematical tools developed for naval warfare (Fourier transforms, conformal mapping) are now used to optimize financial signal paths.
