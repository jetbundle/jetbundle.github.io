# Celestial Mechanics: From Missiles to Space

## The Missile Problem

Financed by "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA," this pillar was the origin of:

- Dynamical Systems
- Linear Algebra
- Topology
- Variational Calculus

## Applications

From Titan-II trajectory optimization to Apollo mid-course corrections, celestial mechanics provided the mathematical framework for space exploration.

## Modern Patrons

Blue Origin, SpaceX, and other private space companies continue to use these mathematical foundations for landing and trajectory optimization.
