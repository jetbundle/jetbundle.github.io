# Hydrodynamics: From Nautilus to HFT

## The Nautilus Problem

Complex analysis and conformal mapping were funded by ONR to design the hydrodynamic hull of the *USS Nautilus* to minimize noise vortices.

## Mathematical Foundations

- Complex Analysis
- Conformal Mapping
- Partial Differential Equations
- Fourier/Laplace Transforms

## Modern Application: HFT

The same mathematical tools used for radar signal processing are now used by HFT firms to optimize "terrestrial microwave networks" and find the "shortest-path (geodesic)" for microsecond advantage.
