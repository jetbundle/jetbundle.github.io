# The Ballistics & Hydrodynamics Stack

## Overview

This stack traces the mathematical foundations of physics from submarine design to high-frequency trading signal paths.

## Key Components

### Hydrodynamics

Complex analysis and conformal mapping were the "Killer App" funded by ONR (est. 1946) to design the hydrodynamic hull of the *USS Nautilus* to minimize noise vortices.

### Celestial Mechanics

Dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, and variational calculus originated from "institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA."

## The Connection to Finance

The same mathematical tools used for naval warfare (Fourier transforms, conformal mapping) are now used in high-frequency trading to optimize signal paths.
